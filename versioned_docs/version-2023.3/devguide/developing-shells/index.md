# Developing Shells

Developers can extend CloudShell’s capabilities to provide additional functionality for Apps or physical devices by creating Shells. This includes better modeling for these components as well as custom commands that can be used in the sandbox to integrate the component in CloudShell. This area of the guide covers the end-to-end flow of creating new Shells and importing them into CloudShell.
