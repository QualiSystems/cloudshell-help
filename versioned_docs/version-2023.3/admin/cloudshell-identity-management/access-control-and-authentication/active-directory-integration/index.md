# Active Directory Integration

CloudShell provides built-in integration with Microsoft Active Directory services for user authentication and authorization. To learn how to use Active Directory with CloudShell, see the following articles:

- [Importing users into CloudShell from an active directory](./importing-users-into-cloudshell-from-an-active-directory.md)
- [Configuring CloudShell to Automatically Import Active Directory Users on First Login](./configuring-cloudshell-to-automatically-import-active-directory-users-on-first-login.md)

If you cannot integrate with Active Directory, we also support integration with an LDAP, SSO or JWT solution:

- [LDAP Integration](../ldap-integration.md)

- [JSON Web Token (JWT) Configuration](../json-web-token-jwt-configuration.md)
