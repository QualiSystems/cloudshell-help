# CloudShell SDK Overview

This guide describes how to download the CloudShell SDK appliance and create a virtual machine (VM) containing the CloudShell SDK from the image that it provides. The CloudShell SDK image deploys a lightweight CloudShell suite installation that will help you to get familiarized with CloudShell and its APIs. It includes a 6 month license that supports 2 concurrent sandbox reservations, as well as Save and Restore.

The CloudShell components that are provided in the VM are:

- Quali Server
- CloudShell Portal
- CloudShell Resource Manager Client
- TestShell Execution Server
- CloudShell License Server
- Database server (based on SQL Express Server 2012)
