# Log into the VM

## Overview

Note that the Linux Execution Server cannot execute TestShell commands and therefore does not require a license.

**To start and login to the new VM:**

1. Power on the new VM and login as root user.
    
    The default credentials are:
    
    Username: **root**
    
    Password: **qs1234**
    
2. Next, as the root user, navigate to the root directory and install the Execution Server. For details, see [Configure the Linux Execution Server](./configure/index.md).
