# Linux Execution Server Virtual Appliance Overview

CloudShell supports Execution Server on Linux (CentOS 7). You can use the image provided in the **CloudShell Execution Server over Linux** to create a virtual machine (VM) that enables the execution of commands in a distributed fashion in a Linux environment, including Ansible configuration management operations on deployed Apps (suite execution is only available for the Windows version). The CloudShell Execution Server application is packaged in the VM that is created using the procedures described in this document. Alternatively, there's a script you can use if you want to configure an existing VM as a Linux Execution Server.

This document describes how to download the solution pack and create VMs from the image that it provides.
