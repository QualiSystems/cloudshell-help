## Description

The connection between the end-user (target) machine and QualiX closed unexpectedly.

## Possible Causes

The target machine does not have an RDP server installed on it and/or there is a connectivity issue not related to CloudShell, which prevents you from accessing the QualiX machine.

## Solution

**To resolve the issue described above, follow these steps:**

1. Install an RDP server on the target machine.
2. Contact your ITÂ department if you do not have connectivity.
3. If you have an RDP server installed, and have connectivity (you are permitted to log on to the machine), contact Customer Support.
