# Show Restored Sandboxes

This article explains how to show a list of active and pending sandboxes that were restored from a specific saved sandbox.

This is useful, for example, if you need to delete a saved sandbox that is associated with an active or pending sandbox, as you must first end or delete the sandbox.

**To show a saved sandbox's restored sandboxes:**

1. In the Saved Sandboxes dashboard, click the Actions button at the end of the row and select Show Restored Sandboxes.
    
    The Sandboxes dashboard is displayed, listing the associated sandboxes.
    
    :::tip
    Alternatively, you can copy the saved sandbox's IDÂ and paste it in the Sandboxes dashboard's search field in the top left corner of the screen.
