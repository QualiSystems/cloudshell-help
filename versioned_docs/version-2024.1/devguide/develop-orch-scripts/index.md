# Developing Orchestration Scripts

Orchestration scripts are a feature in CloudShell that enables the implementation of sandbox workflows. CloudShell has built-in flows for setup and teardown, which deploy and tear down Apps, resources and connections between components in the sandbox without having to add additional code. Users can extend or fork these scripts, as well as implement additional workflows for save/restore operations, scaling, or more use case-specific workflows for anything from performance testing to failover simulation or traffic generation.
