# Inner Join Connections

Connections between tables define an inner join operation between the tables. This means that if table A is connected to table B and you query both tables from your dashboard, then only the records from table A that have a matching record in table B are presented.

Records that exist in table A and that do not have matching records in table B are ignored and vice versa.
