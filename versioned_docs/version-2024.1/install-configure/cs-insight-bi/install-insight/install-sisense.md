# Install Sisense on the BI Server

CloudShell uses Sisense, a powerful 3<sup>rd</sup> party BI and analytics platform. You get Sisense with View permissions, which allows you and your CloudShell users to view the out-of-the-box dashboards. To create/customize dashboards or use any legacy dashboards, you will need more robust Sisense permissions. For details, contact your Technical Account Manager.
