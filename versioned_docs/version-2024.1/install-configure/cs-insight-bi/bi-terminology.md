# BI Terminology

The terminology used in this guide is listed in the following table:

| **Term** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **ElastiCube** | ElastiCube is a data store, designed to withstand extensive querying. The ElastiCube data is cached on the BI server and serves as the data layer for the dashboard.<br/>The default ElastiCube database, named CS\_BI\_Cube, holds the information collected from CloudShell and can be extended with additional data sources, such as external databases, Excel files or web services. |
| **Dashboard** | A dashboard is a set of interactive widgets that queries the information stored in the ElastiCube. You can control the dashboard functionality and design, and share it with additional users. |
| **Widget** | A widget is a dynamic visualization of data. There are many types of widgets available, for example: indicators, pie charts, bar charts, area maps, and pivot tables. |
