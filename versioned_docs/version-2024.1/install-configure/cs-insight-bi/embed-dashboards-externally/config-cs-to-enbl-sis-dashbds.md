# Configure CloudShell to Enable Sharing Insight Dashboards

*Before you perform this procedure, make sure SSO is enabled - see [Configure Sisense to Work with SSO](../insight-sso/configure-sso-in-sisense.md).*

This article explains how to share specific dashboards with other users. You can embed dashboards in your white labeled environments by concatenating parameters to the URL of your dashboard or widget. It is possible to embed an **Insight** widget on your team website using iframe HTML tags. For additional information and customization options, see [here](http://www.sisense.com/documentation/embedding-dashboards-widgets/).

**To enable Insight dashboards to be shared with unregistered users:**

1. In the Insight tab, click the dashboard you want to share.
2. In the dashboard's toolbar, click the **Share** button.
