# Configure the Remaining Cluster Nodes

**To configure the rest of the cluster nodes:**

1. For each node in the cluster, except the first one that is already configured, perform the steps in [Configure Quali Server on the First Cluster Node](./config-quali-server-on-first-node.md).
2. Make sure to use the License server role IP and the AlwaysOn SQL listener IP.
