Before you start, read through the instructions to understand which exercises you need to perform.

Note the time indicator at the top right corner of the screen. It tells you how much time is left in this session. Ask your instructor to extend it if you need more time.

The session’s devices and applications are displayed at the top.

- To connect to a component’s operating system, select the component, click **Connect**. If the device supports more than one way to connect, select the appropriate connection protocol from the context menu (RDP, SSH, Telnet or VNC).
    
    Devices that have an active connection are indicated by a green dot.
