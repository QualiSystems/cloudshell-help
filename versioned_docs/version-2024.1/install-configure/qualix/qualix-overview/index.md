# QualiX Overview

This guide describes how to download the QualiX installation files, perform the installation and configuration to provide a virtual appliance (VA). QualiX can run on a vSphere VA, or on a Docker container. The QualiX VA allows you to integrate Remote Desktop capabilities directly into your browser.

Advantages of working with QualiX:

- Makes working with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) a seamless, integrated experience without the need to use other tools to connect.
- Enables you to use other remote connections, such as SSH and Telnet sessions, to connect to and control machines in a sandbox.
- Provides support for copy/paste operations as well as file transfer to and from the QualiX machine.
- And more...
