# Creating a VM Using the OVA Template

You can use any hypervisor tool that supports the use of OVA images, including open source hypervisors such as VMware Workstation Player.

**To create a VM by deploying the OVA template:**

1. Using your hypervisor tool, deploy the VM using the OVA image you downloaded.
2. When the VM's deployment completes, verify the deployment by powering on the VM and opening the VM console.
    
    The **Settings** screen is displayed.
    
3. Next, follow the [Post Installation](../installation-procedure/post-installation/) procedures to set up the new VM and register CloudShell.
