# Using the Virtual Appliance for CloudShell Operations

After performing the post installation steps, the Virtual Appliance is available to you for use with CloudShell components, such as CloudShell Sandbox API and CloudShell Portal.

**To launch CloudShell Portal:**

- If you are working in the VM, double-click the **CloudShell Portal** icon on the desktop, or open a browser and specify **localhost** in the URL address field and press **Return**. The browser automatically populates the balance of the URL.
- If you are working on a machine outside the VM, ensure that the VM is on, open a browser and specify the IP of the VM in the URL address field and press **Return**. The browser automatically populates the balance of the URL. By default port **80** is used.

**To use CloudShell SDK:**

- When the virtual appliance is installed and configured, you can access the VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or the hypervisor console.
