# Changing the Language in CloudShell Portal

This article explains how to change the display language of CloudShell Portal. This requires the CloudShell administrator to set up language files with the updated captions and texts, as explained in [Customizing the Language File](../../admin/setting-up-cloudshell/cloudshell-configuration-options/customizing-the-language-file.md).

:::note
By default, CloudShell Portal opens in the browser's default language. However, this action changes the default CloudShell Portal language for the logged in user, and applies to all web browsers.
:::

To change the language in CloudShell Portal:

1. Log in to CloudShell Portal.
2. From the user menu, click Select Language and select the suitable language.
    
    :::note
    The Select Language option is only visible if multiple language files exist.
    :::
    
    For example:
    
    ![](/Images/CloudShell-Portal/SelectLanguage.png)
    
    CloudShell Portal is updated accordingly.
