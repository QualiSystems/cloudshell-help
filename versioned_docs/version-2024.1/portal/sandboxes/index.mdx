# Sandboxes

Sandboxes are active sessions of blueprints. They have a start and end time and contain resources and connections. Resources that are reserved exclusively in a sandbox canâ€™t be used in another sandbox at the same time. The sandbox has an owner and permitted users who can both edit the sandbox details (extend the duration of the sandbox, add other users, etc.) and work in the sandbox. You can also save and restore a sandbox with the Save and Restore paid add-on, see [Sandbox Save and Restore Overview](./sandbox-save-and-restore-overview.md).
