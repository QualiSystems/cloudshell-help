# Virtual Network Connectivity

The following articles explain how to set up, configure and manage Virtual Network connectivity in the blueprint or sandbox to connect Apps and/or resources to each other. Virtual networks are created using VLAN services or subnets. VLAN services resolve L2 connections involving private cloud Apps and/or resources, such as vCenter, while Subnet services resolve connections between Apps on a public cloud, such as AWS EC2 and Azure.

Physical layer connectivity for resources is also supported - see [Physical Network Connectivity](../add-physical-network/index.md).
