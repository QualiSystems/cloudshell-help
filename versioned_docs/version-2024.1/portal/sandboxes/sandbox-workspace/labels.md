# Labels

Labels make the sandbox more readable by visually grouping your sandbox's resources, Apps, and services according to some shared quality or characteristic, like "Spine Network", "Web Servers" or "Firewall."

:::note Notes
- Labels are created in the blueprint and can be used in the sandbox. For additional information, see [Labels in Blueprints](../../blueprints/creating-blueprints/labels.md).
- Labels are only visible in **Diagram** view.
