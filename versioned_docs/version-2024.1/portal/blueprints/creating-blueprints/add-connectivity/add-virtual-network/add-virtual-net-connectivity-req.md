# Add Virtual Network Connectivity Requirements

Virtual Network connectivity is achieved using VLAN or Subnet services, which create virtual networks. VLAN-based virtual networks enable connections between private cloud Apps, such as vCenter and OpenStack, and support both peer-to-peer and many-to-many connections, and can be used to connect Apps and/or physical resources. Subnet-based networks are used to connect AWS EC2 or Azure Apps to each other. They do this by creating, for every subnet service in the sandbox, a dedicated subnet in the AWS EC2/Azure cloud that allows connecting multiple Apps of the same cloud provider to each other.

## Adding peer-to-peer connectivity route

There are two peer-to-peer connectivity types, physical (L1-based) and network layer (L2 or subnet network-based). The network layer connectivity type uses a **Connector** route, while for physical layer connections, a **Route** connection type is used and CloudShell selects the L1 resources that are needed to resolve each connection.
:::note
For P2P connections between two AWS EC2 or Azure Apps, CloudShell creates a subnet with 16 IPs.
:::
**To add peer-to-peer connectivity:**

1. In the diagram, hover over an endpoint. From the context menu, select the **Create Connection** option.
    :::tip
    Admins can customize the peer-to-peer connections in a sandbox by adding the P2P VLAN Default service to the diagram and modifying its settings as appropriate.
    :::
2. Click a target App or resource to connect.
    
    An indication message is displayed.

    If at least one of the endpoints is an App, a **Connector** route is created. However, if both endpoints are physical resources but you want to connect them using an L2-based connection, in the **Resource Connections** dialog box, you will need to select **Connector**, click the source and target endpoint ports, click **Add** and then click **Save**.
    

1. A Connector route between the endpoints is created.
    
2. Blueprint designers can optionally configure the connectivity requirement's settings.

## Adding many-to-many connectivity

This method enables you to connect multiple endpoints to each other by linking them to the same Virtual Network service in the blueprint. In a sandbox, users can select to connect or disconnect specific routes that are connected to the VLAN service or to connect all routes from the VLAN service's **Commands** pane.

**To add many-to-many connectivity:**

1. In the diagram, add the appropriate VLAN or Subnet service to the canvas.
    
    Use the **VLAN Auto** service to have CloudShell automatically select the VLAN ID, use the **VLAN Manual** service to specify a particular VLAN IDÂ to use, or use the **Subnet** service to create a new subnet in the AWS EC2 or Azure cloud, and connect AWS EC2/Azure Apps to it.
    :::tip
    Before you add a Subnet service, read through [Subnet Connectivity - Points to Consider](../../../../../admin/setting-up-cloudshell/inventory-operations/connectivity-control/subnet-connectivity/subnet-connectivity--points-to-consider.md).
    :::
2. If the **Add Service** dialog box is displayed, configure the parameters available for the service you added. Depending on the service, certain parameters may be read only.
    
    ![](/Images/CloudShell-Portal/Lab-Management/Working-with-Apps/VLAN-Add-Service-dialog.png)
    
    The parameters are:
    
    - **Alias**: display name for the service in the diagram
    - **Access Mode**: (For VLAN services) Interface VLAN mode
    - **Virtual Network**: (For VLAN services) (Read only) Allocated virtual network. The value is displayed only after the virtual network is selected and activated.
    - **VLAN ID**: (For VLAN services) VLAN ID to use for the connection
    - **Public**: (For Subnet services) Determine if the Subnet is connected to the internet.
    - **Subnet Size**: (For Subnet services) Select the subnet size of this service (block size of the subnet CIDR). Possible values: 16, 32, 64, 128 (corresponding to block sizes of /28, /27, /26 and /25).
        
        :::note Notes
        - Since each cloud provider has a few IPs in each subnet reserved for networking services, the actual number of Apps that can be added to a subnet is lower than the number set in the subnet size attribute. Currently in AWS, 5 IPs are reserved.
        - When adding multiple VLAN or subnet services, keep in mind the total maximum number of IPs per sandbox is 255.

3. Click **Add**.
4. Drag an App or resource to the canvas.
5. Hover over it. From the context menu, select the **Create Connection** option.
6. Click the service.
    
    An indication message is displayed.

    A **Connector** route between the endpoints is created.

7. Repeat to link additional Apps or resources to the service.
8. Blueprint designers can optionally configure the connectivity requirement's settings for the endpoints.
