# Add Multiple Physical Network Connectivity Requirements

You can specify multiple source and target ports to use to make the connection between two resources. Using this method, CloudShell will use the first available ports in the source and target lists to make the connection.

**To create multiple connections:**

1. In the **Resource Connections** dialog box, click the **Bulk Connections** tab.
2. Filter the ports you want CloudShell to consider for the connection.
3. Click the **Add all** button.
4. Click **Save**.
