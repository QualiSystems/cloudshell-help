# Name your Blueprint

By default, new blueprint names follow this format: "Blueprint\<date\>\<time\>". Blueprints created from a template use the template's name.

**To enter a name for the blueprint:**

1. In the blueprint workspace header, click the **Name** field and enter the required name.
    
    Note: The blueprint's name has a limit of 60 characters and can only contain alpha-numeric characters, spaces, and the following characters: | . - \_ \] \[
    
2. Click **Enter** to confirm.
