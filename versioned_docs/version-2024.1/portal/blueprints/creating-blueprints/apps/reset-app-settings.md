**To update an App:**

1. Open the blueprint diagram.
2. Hover over the App. From the **More Options** menu, select the **Refresh From Template** option.
    :::note
    If the App's template has been deleted, this option will not be available.
    :::
3. In the confirmation window, click **Yes**.
    :::note
    If the App's default deployment path has been renamed or removed from the App template, the operation will complete but the App will not be associated to a deployment path.
