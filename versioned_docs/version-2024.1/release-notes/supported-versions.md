Supported CloudShell Versions
=============================

CloudShell offers two support phases:

*   **Premier Support Phase:** This phase begins from the release of a version and lasts for 18 months from the release date. During this phase, customers are entitled to full support services for this version including any hotfixes or patches.
*   **Extended Support Phase:** This phase applies to all releases that are 18 - 30 months from their original release date. During this phase, customers are entitled to all support services apart from bug fixes on those releases. Bugs that are found in versions that are in the Extended Support phase may be fixed in later versions and customers will be asked to upgrade to a version that is then in its Premier support phase.

**Note:** Quali continues to support releases under the extended support plan. However, bugs found on these versions may only be fixed in later releases. Quali does not provide any technical assistance or fixes for releases that reached end of support. This is the time to make sure that you have upgraded to the latest available CloudShell release.
