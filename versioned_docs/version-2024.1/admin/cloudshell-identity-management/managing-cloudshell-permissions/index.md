# Managing CloudShell Permissions

The System Administrator specifies which resources and blueprints are available to each domain.

Permissible actions in a blueprint for users other than the blueprint owner are determined by a combination of the user type, group membership, and the group's access level in the current domain.

Permissible actions in a sandbox are determined by a combination of the user type, group membership, the group's access level in the current domain, and the current sandbox status.
