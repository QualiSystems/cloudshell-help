# Archiving and Restoring Domains

This article explains how to archive and restore domains. Archiving domains applies to scenarios where the domain is no longer needed but you want to keep it for future use. It is also possible to delete domains that are no longer needed as well as set an end date on domains in the domain's properties tab (for details, see [Domains Window](../../../admin/cloudshell-identity-management/cloudshell-domains/domains-window.md)).

## Archiving domains

**To archive a domain that is no longer needed**:

1. Click the **Admin** tab's **Domains** icon to open the **Domains Explorer** window.

2. In the **Domains Explorer**, double-click a domain or right-click a domain and choose **Open** from the context menu to open the domain's tab.
3. Click the **Archive** button, to the right of the **Edit** button next to the **Domain Name** field.

## Deleting domains

**To delete a domain**:

1. Click the **Admin** tab's **Domains** icon to open the **Domains Explorer** window.  
    ![](/Images/Admin-Guide/User-Management/DomainsButton.png)
2. In the **Domains Explorer**, select the domain that you wish to delete and click the toolbar's **Delete** icon.
3. Click **OK** to confirm.

## Restoring archived domains

Unlike deleted domains, archived domains can be restored. Restoring an archived domain restores all associated groups and allocated resources and blueprints. Deleted sandboxes will not be restored.

**To restore an archived domain**:

1. Click the Admin tab's **Domains** icon to open the **Domains Explorer** window.
2. In the **Domains Explorer**, if archived domains aren't visible, click the toolbar's **Show Archived Domains** icon.
3. Double-click a domain or right-click a domain and choose **Open** from the context menu to open the domain's tab.
4. Click the **Unarchive** button, to the right of the **Edit** button next to the **Domain Name** field.
