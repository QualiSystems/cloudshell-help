# Private Cloud Provider Support in CloudShell

In order to allow CloudShell Apps to deploy and manage virtual machines in a private cloud provider such as VMware vCenter, the system administrator needs to create a cloud provider resource in the Inventory dashboard. This resource provides the cloud provider's network, storage and access settings to the CloudShell Apps.

In addition, CloudShell App deployments can be associated to specific domains to improve performance in geographically dispersed CloudShell deployments.
