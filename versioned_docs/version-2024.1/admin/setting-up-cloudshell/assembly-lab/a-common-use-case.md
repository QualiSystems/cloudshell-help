# A Common Use Case

## Overview
In a typical use case, Assembly Lab facilitates collaboration between two groups of users: lab managers and customers.

### Lab Managers

- Responsible for managing the lab and overseeing work orders.
- Ensure that resources are allocated efficiently and that the lab environment meets the specified requirements.

### Customers

- Submit requests using blueprints, which may represent new use cases or environments.
- Interact with lab managers through the sandbox to negotiate requirements and find solutions.

## Recommendations

#### Sandbox Interaction

The sandbox environment enables lab managers and customers to negotiate over requirements and make adjustments as needed. This can involve shifting devices around or changing abstract requirements to something more feasible.

#### Capability Sets

User groups can be managed through capability sets, ensuring that each group has the appropriate access levels and permissions.

#### Sticky Notes

Sticky notes can be placed in blueprints and sandboxes to clarify requirements and communicate important information.

#### Work Order Comments

Lab managers can leave comments on each record in the work order, allowing customers to track progress and stay informed about the status of their requests.
