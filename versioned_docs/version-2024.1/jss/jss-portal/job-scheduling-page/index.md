# Job Scheduling Page

The **Job Scheduling** page is the main page in the Job Scheduling Portal. Here you can create, manage and execute suites in the selected domain.

:::note
Admins can view, modify and run all suites in the domain while regular users can only modify suites they own. For details, see [Job Scheduling dashboard](../../../admin/cloudshell-identity-management/managing-cloudshell-permissions/cloudshell-user-permission-levels-rbac.md#job-scheduling-dashboard).
