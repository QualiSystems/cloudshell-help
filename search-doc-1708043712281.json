Creating an IT environment blueprint can be as simple as dragging the resources you need from the inventory and creating the connections between them. CloudShell significantly reduces blueprint configuration time (by automating the management of IT resources), offers clear visibility into your organization’s resources and their availability status, and optimizes resource use. With a robust data analysis and visualization engine, CloudShell provides you with business insights into your IT infrastructure, including health, consumption and availability data. CloudShell offers the following features and capabilities: Web-based self-service portal and catalogInventory managementIntegration with ANY infrastructure, private and public clouds, and industry-specific infrastructure both directly and via automation tools or APIsResource allocation management of exclusive/shared resources, conflict resolutionBlueprint modeling, easy-to-use editor with drag-and-drop capabilities allowing you to create operational blueprints in minutesReservation and schedulingNetworking: L1 (physical layer), L2 (VLAN) and L3 (subnet)Infrastructure automation, configuration management and environment orchestrationRole-based access control, Active Directory and SSO integrationGrowing developer community with technical developer forums and 100s of open-source integrations for leading clouds providers, devices, CI/CD tools, etc, providing accessibility, control and common day-2 actionsDistributed execution provisioning allowing for scale, latency mitigation and quick delivery Test automationBI reporting: Sandbox consumption and licenses, resource utilization, inventory, cloud usage, user activity, etcIn-browser access to resources using SSH, RDP and moreLive activity feed displaying real-time deployment activity messages, errors and warnings For details, see CloudShell Features and Benefits.","keywords":"","version":"2023.1 GA"},{"title":"empty page","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cloudshell-help/2023.1 GA/jss/example","content":"empty page","keywords":"","version":"2023.1 GA"},{"title":"CloudShell Features and Benefits","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cloudshell-help/2023.1 GA/Introduction/features-and-concepts/features-and-benefits","content":"CloudShell Features and Benefits Faster time to market: Easy-to-use drag-and-drop blueprint editor allows you to set up operational blueprints in minutes Python-based environment orchestration and provisioning Vibrant developer community containing growing number of open-source shells for 100s of physical devices, virtual appliances, private and public clouds Shells - Python-based plugins for discovering lab and cloud infrastructure More...

Therefore, to allow your CloudShell scripts and drivers to use the packages residing in the old repository, you will need to copy them to the local PyPi Server repository. note This procedure only applies to your offline Python packages (i.e. packages that do not reside on the public PyPi repository) or if your CloudShell deployment is offline, as in online mode, PyPi Server downloads and serves online packages automatically when a script or driver requiring such packages is executed. To copy the packages to the local PyPi Server repository: If you have access to the Quali Server machine, manually copy the packages from the old repository on the Quali Server and/or Execution Servers. If you don't have access to the Quali Server machine, use the Setup or Twine command line methods, as explained in PyPi Server - Managing Python Shell and Script Dependencies. Restart the relevant services (Quali Server service on the CloudShell Server machine, and TestShell Execution Server service on each updated Execution Server machine). note There is no need to remove the &lt;PythonOfflineRepositoryPath&gt; key from the customer.config file in the CloudShell and Execution Server installation directories as CloudShell will ignore it.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Upgrade Preparation","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cloudshell-help/next/install-configure/cloudshell-suite/upgrade-procedure/upgrade-prep","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"General upgrade notes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Upgrade Preparation","url":"/cloudshell-help/next/install-configure/cloudshell-suite/upgrade-procedure/upgrade-prep#general-upgrade-notes","content":" If you're using Packaging API, we recommend you upgrade your package editor version to the one included in this CloudShell release - Getting Started with Packaging API.

The files are used to copy the production database information to the standalone environment as a backup for the production database in case a rollback is required.  In a virtualized environment, consider creating an image of the Quali Server and client machines for a quick and easy rollback in case it is needed.  In the validation environment:  Follow the Installation Guide and install the same CloudShell version that is currently installed on your production environment.Install the 3rd party applications (Traffic Generator GUI applications, Ranorex, and so on).Install a database management application.Restore the production environment database files.Activate CloudShell and verify that all applications are functional.In Resource Manager, perform the following steps: Verify that all resources exist in the Resource Explorer.Verify that you can create, edit, and delete sandboxes and activate blueprints.Verify that resources can launch commands and applications.  note Make sure your validation environment is ready before continuing to the next step.  If you are using an L1 switch in your environment, stop usage of any L1 switches that are shared with the production environment. An L1 switch can be controlled only by a single Quali Server at any time. Since the L1 switch is usually a shared resource between the production and validation environments, it is required to stop the usage of the L1 switch on the production environment, before using it in the validation environment. That includes closing all Resource Manager Client applications and any driver projects that use the TestShell API library. Run the setup.exe file to perform the upgrade.

Out of the box, CloudShell is installed on Windows along with the Sandbox Service, MongoDB and RabbitMQ service, while the New Job Scheduling services (introduced in CloudShell 2020.2) are deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. New Job Scheduling deployments come with their own Sandbox Service, MongoDB and RabbitMQ installations on Kubernetes to support high load. For details about the ports required for communication between the components, see CloudShell Port Requirements. For details about CloudShell in High Availability mode, see Deployment Types (High Availability). Notes about the diagram below: A green frame denotes components related to the New Job Scheduling.Components in orange are 3rd party tools/technologies.The Insight, QualiX and Portal machines are typically installed outside the private data center in the DMZ network. The CloudShell components are described in the following table: * TestShell, CloudShell Authoring and Job Scheduling are CloudShell paid add-on solutions. Component\tDescriptionCloudShell Authoring*\tCode-free hardware interface editor for quick driver development for any blueprint, supporting full equipment interchangeability and automatic documentation for easy collaboration. CloudShell Execution Server\tRemotely executes setup, teardown and sandbox commands. It can also execute test suites and jobs from the Job Scheduling dashboard. This component adds to CloudShell Portal's total execution capacity. Execution servers can be either Windows or Linux-based. CloudShell License Server\tManages network license distribution. The License Server can be installed on any machine, and should be installed before installing client components. CloudShell Portal\tA self-service web client that enables you to manage your resources, create and manage blueprints and sandboxes, as well as manage and schedule your automated testing. You can leverage CloudShell’s extensive automation capabilities to run blueprint and resource commands as well as automate business use cases within Sandboxes. CloudShell Resource Management Client\tUse CloudShell Resource Manager to manage resources and usage. For an example of using this component, see Import User Definitions from an Active Directory (Optional). CloudShell Runtime\tSupports the execution of CloudShell flows and drivers. CloudShell Sandbox API\tThe CloudShell Sandbox API is a REST API that enables you to consume and interact with CloudShell sandboxes. Using Sandbox API, it is possible to integrate CloudShell with software interfaces to develop and automate Continuous Integration/DevOps processes. For example, you can use API functions to view details about blueprints and sandboxes related to a particular user domain and user permissions, and the available actions that can be performed on the blueprints and sandboxes. The Sandbox API consists of three components, which reside on the CloudShell Portal machine: CloudShell Server Proxy - communicates with Quali Server, and communicates internally with CloudShell Sandbox API GatewayCloudShell Sandbox API Gateway - communicates internally with CloudShell Sandbox APICloudShell Sandbox API - communicates with API Client Database Servers\tCloudShell uses SQL and MongoDB. SQL for CloudShell-related data such as blueprints, user identities, inventory resources, configurations, Apps and Insight data for BI analysis. MongoDB is an open source database used to store sandbox events, New Job Scheduling-related data (suites, jobs, tests, reports, etc.) and permitted user identities.MongoDB instances for Quali Server and Sandbox Service are installed as part of the Quali Server installation. There's also an option to use an existing MongoDB Server or cluster. Elastic Search\tThe 64-bit version of Java is required when using a 64-bit version of Windows. PyPi Server\tCloudShell manages driver and script dependencies using PyPi Server. Quali API\tThe Quali API library provides access to job scheduling operations from outside of the Job Scheduling dashboard, as well as functions related to sandboxes, for example, attach file to sandbox and import and export of blueprints. Quali Server\tRuns the CloudShell framework and manages CloudShell data. QualiX\tUsed for remote desktop gateway (must be accessible from CloudShell Portal and the browsers) Sandbox Service\tSandbox Service is a Python service that comes in two flavors: Windows service (embedded) delivered as part of Quali Server and Linux service included with the New Job Scheduling on Kubernetes (this second flavor supports extremely large deployments, up to hundreds of new sandboxes every few minutes). As such, we also recommend moving the Sandbox Service to the Kubernetes cluster option even for high load deployments without the New Job Scheduling. This service performs two key functions: Processes, prioritizes and invokes all sandbox creation requests against Quali Server. As such, starting with CloudShell 2020.2, Sandbox Service replaces the reservation creation mechanism that was used in pre-2020.2 CloudShell versions, also in deployments that do not use the New Job Scheduling. The Windows flavor of the service includes a healthcheck mechanism that actively monitors and restarts the service in the event of a failure.Acts as the communication layer between Job Scheduling and Quali Server when handling New Job Scheduling operations. In deployments that use New Job Scheduling, the Kubernetes-based service needs to be used instead of the Sandbox Service that comes out-of-the-box with Quali Server. For details, see Modify CloudShell to Use the Kubernetes-based Services. For upgrades in CloudShell environments that have Docker, Sandbox Service will be installed externally on Docker and the UseEmbeddedSandboxService configuration key needs to be used to configure the deployment to use this external Sandbox Service. Sisense\tCloudShell Insight (BI Server). TestShell API\tThe TestShell API library comprises functions for interacting with Quali Server. For example, you can use API functions to create and configure resources, blueprints, routes, and Sandboxes. This API library also provides a set of lab management batch operation functions. TestShell Remote Runner*\tExecutes TestShell-specific automation steps or complete scenarios on remote stations, enabling the launch of any script or protocol on a remote machine, without requiring complex infrastructure. TestShell Studio*\tDesktop applications for GUI based test authoring and execution. (Studio and Runner are automatically installed with TestShell Studio.) New Job Scheduling* Components: ELK\tELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) is a 3rd party tool that can be used to store CloudShell logs. These logs can then be used to investigate deployment issues and bugs, and trace their causes. External Test Repository\tOnline GitLab test repository that contains tests of a specific type. For example, GitLab. Identity Service\tIdentity Service is our authentication engine for the New Job Scheduling and creates users based on Quali’s identity management mechanism, allowing these users to access and use the Job Scheduling Portal and REST API clients. Job Scheduling Portal\tREST API-driven UI client that is used to interact with New Job Scheduling. Job Scheduling Portal is separate from CloudShell Portal. Job Scheduling Service\tJob Scheduling Service is a high-performance test automation framework that allows organizations to create, manage and execute test batches. The service is hosted on a Kubernetes cluster and uses Quali Server to extract user, blueprint and sandbox data. RabbitMQ\tOpen source message queuing tool used by Sandbox Service to manage sandbox creation requests coming from the Job Scheduling Portal and APIs. If needed, RabbitMQ is installed as part of the Quali Server. Test Discovery Service\tTest Discovery Service is responsible for discovering tests of a specific type. A Test Discovery Service can only discover tests of a specific type in a specific repository. For more information, see Test Discovery Service. Test Execution Service\tTest Execution Service is responsible for running tests discovered by the Test Discovery Service. For more information, see Test Execution Service. Important: Test Execution Service does not handle shell and script commands. CloudShell Execution Servers are required to handle such operations.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"CloudShell Port Requirements","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cloudshell-help/next/install-configure/cs-system-requirements/cs-port-requirements","content":"CloudShell Port Requirements This article illustrates the CloudShell suite component architecture and ports used by CloudShell.

Import the traffic generator chassis shell into CloudShell. In the appropriate domain, create a chassis resource with the details of your chassis device or VM (if your chassis is provided as a virtual appliance). Import the traffic generator controller shell into CloudShell. Since the controller is a service, if you're not planning on working in the Global domain, you will need to expose the service to the appropriate domain. This is done by associating the service to a service category that is assigned to the domain. If your controller is a 1st Gen shell, in Resource Manager Client, open the Resource Families explorer, click the service family and associate the service category. For 2nd Gen service shells, assign the shell's service category to the appropriate domain in the Manage dashboard. Create a blueprint in the domain. Add the controller service, chassis ports that will be used in the traffic test, and any additional resources/Apps as appropriate.

For additional commands and use cases, see the readme file that comes with your traffic generator shell.  In the sandbox, open the controller's commands pane. Run these commands in the following order: Run Load Configuration to load the configuration file prepared by your admin to the controller. The configuration file includes the settings according to which the traffic test will be run. For example, packet size, number of packets to send in parallel, interval at which to send packet batches, etc. Points to consider: The file must be accessible to the execution server that will run the traffic test.The configuration file provides a unique name for each port on the chassis. Therefore, in order to assign a port on the configuration file to a port on the chassis, you must specify the file's defined port name on the port in CloudShell. To do so, drag the port resource into the diagram from the Add Resource catalog, open its Resource Structure pane, click the port's drop-down list and select Attributes, and in the Logical Name field, specify the port's name. note Since traffic operations may take longer than the default 10 minute idle timeout period set for shell drivers, once you run the first command on the traffic generator controller, the controller will remain in a &quot;running&quot; state (indicated by the turning wheel on the controller service) until the reservation ends or the shell driver process is manually terminated. Run Start Traffic to generate and send the traffic to the DUT according to the settings provided in the configuration file. Set the Blocking input to decide how to run the traffic test (True to run synchronously or False to run asynchronously). In synchronous mode, CloudShell waits for the traffic test to complete before allowing additional traffic commands to run, and in asynchronous mode, you can run additional commands while the traffic test is running. Run Stop Traffic to stop sending traffic from the traffic generator. This does not terminate the controller's shell driver process, so if the Start Traffic command is running in synchronous mode, all subsequent commands will still have to wait for the traffic test to complete. Run Get Statistics. This command returns the traffic test's statistics in JSON or CSV format. Set the command's inputs: View Name: Type of statistics to return. For example, Port Statistics, Traffic Item Statistics, Flow Statistics, etc. The types available may differ depending on the traffic generator.Output Type (Enum): JSON or CSV. JSON prints the statistics to the reservation's output, which is useful for API calls that can then use the output, while CSV attaches a CSV file with the test's statistics to the sandbox.

Provisioning - This is the main stage of the setup process. In this stage, CloudShell locks unshared resources for the duration of the sandbox, deploys the sandbox's Apps and prepares App connectivity in the respective cloud providers. Connectivity - CloudShell creates the physical and virtual network connections for the sandbox's resources and Apps, and powers on the App VMs. Configuration - If any of the sandbox's Apps have configuration management operations that need to be run, CloudShell runs them in this stage.

To create an immediate or future sandbox:  In the Blueprint Catalog, on the required blueprint tile, click Reserve. Alternatively, in the blueprint workspace, click the Reserve button. The Reserve dialog box is displayed. tip The timezone for the sandbox is indicated in the title of the Reserve dialog box. If the blueprint is defined as a persistent blueprint, select the Sandbox Type you want to deploy: Regular Sandbox to spin up a time-limited sandboxPersistent Sandbox to deploy a persistent sandbox with no end time. For details, see Persistent Sandboxes Overview. In the Schedule field, you can set the required sandbox duration or specify the explicit start and/or end time. Use the Calendar button to set future dates.  Notes Most of the scheduling options are disabled for persistent blueprints.For non-persistent sandboxes, if a maximum duration was set for the sandbox, the user will not be able to reserve for a duration beyond this setting.  (Unavailable for persistent blueprints) To have this sandbox repeat in a series, click Add Recurrence. If this option is missing, the admin needs to enable it using the EnableRecurringReservation key. The Recurrence page is displayed. To have the sandbox repeat on specific days, click the Pattern field and either select the days or select Daily to have the sandbox repeat on all days of the week.In the Range field, define the period in which the sandbox will repeat. Optionally, change the Name of the sandbox. By default, the new sandbox name is the blueprint name. note The sandbox’s name has a limit of 60 characters. In the Blueprint field, you can see the blueprint on which the sandbox is based. To specify additional options, click the Advanced Form button. The advanced form enables you to configure the email notifications, permissions and other options. Optionally, enter a Description. Otherwise, the description of the sandbox will default to the blueprint description. To define an owner for the sandbox, click the Owner and select the required user. By default, the user who initiated the scheduling action is set as the sandbox owner. Instead of changing the owner of the sandbox, you can permit additional users to use the sandbox. Click the Permitted Users section and select the users you wish to add. To prevent users from ending the sandbox before its scheduled end time, enable Termination Protection. This option ensures your sandbox isn't ended accidentally or prematurely. And when you are ready to manually end the sandbox, disable the option in the sandbox's properties window and then end it. You can configure CloudShell to send email notifications to the owner of the sandbox and permitted users. note This capability requires the administrator to activate the email notifications feature using the ReservationEmail configuration keys. Click the Email Notifications field. The Email Notifications area expands. Configure the email notification settings. On start - Sends notification as the sandbox starts. On setup complete - Sends notification when the sandbox setup completes. Before end - (Unavailable for persistent blueprints) Sends notification before the Teardown process begins. The exact time is decided by the user. note By default, it is not possible to launch a sandbox that has a shorter duration than the Before end period. However, your admin can enable this capability using the ReservationEmail.VerifyNotificationBeforeEndLongerThanDuration configuration key. On end - Sends when the sandbox ends. If the blueprint has inputs (global inputs, published abstract resource or service inputs), you will be asked to provide them. tip To expand the value area, click and drag down the icon in the bottom right corner of the frame. Click Reserve. The sandbox is being reserved. If you are reserving a blueprint that has the Default Sandbox Setup script, the script runs, and an indication next to the sandbox state informs you of its progress. More details Note that during the Setup process, the sandbox is locked in CloudShell Portal and cannot be modified - see Unlocking sandboxes for use during the Setup process. The default setup process has 4 stages: Preparation - Prepare network connections for the sandbox's Apps and any additional custom preparations. note This stage is not used by default, but can be used for custom code executions that need to run before the setup process. Provisioning - This is the main stage of the setup process. In this stage, CloudShell locks unshared resources for the duration of the sandbox, deploys the sandbox's Apps and prepares App connectivity in the respective cloud providers. Connectivity - CloudShell creates the physical and virtual network connections for the sandbox's resources and Apps, and powers on the App VMs. Configuration - If any of the sandbox's Apps have configuration management operations that need to be run, CloudShell runs them in this stage. If any resource is unavailable for the scheduled time slot, the Conflicts dialog box is displayed, proposing an alternative time slot, as described in Dealing with conflicts. The new sandbox is displayed in Diagram view with a blue Sandbox label at the top of the canvas and a green Active icon in the toolbar: note For persistent blueprints, the blue Sandbox label is replaced with a Persistent Environment label. If you have a license for the Save and Restore paid add-on, you will see a Save Sandbox button. For more information, see the Sandbox Save and Restore Overview.

For details, see Blueprint Approval Policy.  note Admins and blueprint owners have full permissions on their blueprints and can therefore reserve their approval blueprints without going through the approval process.  To request approval:  In the Blueprint Catalog, click the blueprint's Request button. The Request Approval dialog box is displayed. Fill in the details. The Approval Validity period defines the time frame in which you plan to create the sandbox, and the Max Sandbox Duration defines the maximum period of the sandbox to be created. Enable Unlimited Request to set a validity period with no end time. Notes Once the request is approved, you will be able to start the sandbox at any time within the period as long as the sandbox also ends within the alloted time frame.The approval applies to a single sandbox reservation. In other words, you cannot start the sandbox, end it and start a new one on the same approval. Optionally enter Notes relating to the request. If the blueprint has published inputs, specify their values. Click Request Approval.

This integration offers considerable time savings by automating the running and verification of your automation processes and tests through CloudShell sandboxes. note You may need to collaborate with different people in your organization to complete some of these tasks. To integrate CloudShell with your CI tool: Install the desired CloudShell CI plugin on your CI tool. Official CloudShell CI plugins such as Jenkins and TeamCity are available in Quali Repositories. Configure the CloudShell connection details on your CI tool, as explained in the plugin's documentation. Design a blueprint that suits your CI process. Make sure the blueprint's Setup script includes all the automation that is required for the test. For details, see CloudShell Dev Guide's CloudShell's OOB Orchestration.In addition, the CI tool must wait for the sandbox's setup process to complete before running the test. Note that CloudShell's Default Sandbox Setup script provides this functionality. Create your first build in the CI tool, as detailed in the plugin's documentation. This includes specifying the blueprint's name, duration, inputs, and any optional details, as appropriate. note CloudShell CI plugins only work with public blueprints. tip Use the Stop Sandbox functionality that is provided by the CloudShell CI plugin to automatically free up your sandbox's resources once the automation process or test completes. Run the build to make sure that it works. Make sure the CI tool waits for the sandbox's setup process to complete before running the test. This is done automatically by Setup scripts that are based on CloudShell's Default Sandbox Setup script. Make sure a new sandbox is created in CloudShell with the specified configurations. Add your custom automation process or test to the CI build, using your preferred plugin language. The CloudShell CI plugin populates the sandbox's details in the build so it can be used in your automation process or test. Rerun your build to verify the end-to-end flow. Now that the build is fully configured, you can add it to your CI workflow and monitor the results.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Modeling Public Cloud Services in CloudShell","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cloudshell-help/next/portal/overview/end-to-end-wf/model-public-cloud","content":"Modeling Public Cloud Services in CloudShell In some scenarios, you may want to model a public cloud service or a SaaS product in the sandbox. For example: Modeling an AWS caching service as an element in a sandboxModeling a Salesforce service to allow retrieving Salesforce information in sandbox orchestration. In this scenario, the Salesforce service doesn’t have to be an element in any sandbox. This is done by creating a CloudShell service shell that contains all the relevant attributes, automation and logic required to access and use the cloud service. For this purpose, we’ve created the Cloud Service Shell Standard, which provides the framework for implementing support for cloud services. To create a cloud service: Create a service shell using the gen2/cloud-service shell template. See Creating a Shell from a template. Add the relevant automation and attributes. See Customizing Shells. Package and install the shell on CloudShell. See Packaging and importing a Shell into CloudShell. Expose the shell to the relevant domains. See Associating categories to a service shell. Optionally, set up orchestration scripts, which will use the shell’s commands, and add them to the relevant blueprints. See Getting Started with Orchestration Scripts. note It is also possible to create an admin-only service that is hidden from regular users in the sandbox.

When you reserve the blueprint, CloudShell will create the connections for you.  To set up connectivity between 2 resources:  Hover over a resource and select the Create Connection option. Then, click the other resource. In the Resource Connections dialog box, from the Connection Type dropdown list, select Route (Logical) to create a L1 connection or Connector for a L2 connection. Select a port on the source resource and one on the target and click Add. Repeat this step to add additional connection routes. Click Save. Physical routes are represented by black dotted lines between the resources, as illustrated in the image below. Notes: If a connection route is purple, that’s because you defined a Connector type of a connection. This is used for L2 connections and will fail unless you have an L2 resource orvCenter dvSwitch connecting the endpoints. Edit the route connection to open the Resource Connections dialog box, click the Inventory tab in the dialog box, delete the connections and create new ones.If you defined an L1 connection in the blueprint but the connection line is orange, that’s because there’s no L1 switch resource connecting the endpoints. Notify the administrator. At this point, they’re just connection requirements. When the sandbox starts, CloudShell will activate the connections, replacing the dotted lines with solid ones.

The basic components are:  CloudShell Portal: CloudShell's web portal that allows end users to reserve blueprints on demand from a self-service catalog, and enables admins and designers to administer CloudShell and create blueprints.Quali Server: Processes requests, manages and shares data/resources with CloudShell clients (Portal, APIs, etc.) from the CloudShell databases (MySQL, MongoDB).Execution Server: CloudShell component that executes commands and tests. Multiple execution servers can be installed for distributed provisioning.  Make sure the machine(s) that will host CloudShell comply with our CloudShell System Requirements. info CloudShell’s servers and clients can coexist on the same machine, but for load/performance reasons, you might want to consider installing high-load components such as Quali Server, CloudShell Portal and the Execution Servers on dedicated machines. Install and configure CloudShell suite. For details, see CloudShell Suite Installation Overview. You can also install CloudShell in a High Availability configuration. We highly recommend using CloudShell’s Insight, our BI platform. Insight is provided free of charge with out-of-the-box resource utilization and activity dashboards, but can be customized as a paid add-on. For details, see CloudShell Insight BI.

A domain is basically a space that includes the resources, Apps and blueprints that apply to a specific team, project or geographically-distributed site in your organization, and the users that belong to that team or site.  Groups are the link that connects users to a domain. Each group has a role, which is delegated to that group’s members in the domain. As such, you could have a single user with different roles in different domains. That user could be a “regular user” in one domain but a “domain admin” in another.

For details on how to create these components, see the related topics section that follows.  Each one of these components is based on a shell, which is a plugin that defines how the component will behave in the sandbox. A shell models a specific component, so if we want to create a Juniper switch, we’ll need a Juniper switch shell and to deploy or load a Google Cloud VM, we’ll need a shell that can do that. To quickly see how CloudShell works, we recommend using our PUT and Traffic Generator mock shells.  CloudShell supports 4 types of components:  Resource models an actual physical or virtual device. It could be a layer 2 Cisco switch or some existing virtual appliance on the cloud that you’d like to load into CloudShell. Feel free to use our PUT Shell Mock and Traffic Shell Mock resources.App is the definition of virtual application to be deployed as part of the sandbox. It defines the VM to be deployed and configuration management script or playbook that will install the application(s) on top of the VM. Apps live in the context of a sandbox and when the sandbox ends, CloudShell’s teardown script will also delete the VM from the cloud.Service is a sandbox component that injects some code into the sandbox. It could be used to register to a cloud-based service like a traffic generator on Azure.Abstract resource is a component that includes the settings you need from a specific resource. When the blueprint is reserved, CloudShell finds a matching resource in the CloudShell inventory and puts it in the blueprint instead of the abstract. Abstract resources provide the blueprint with additional flexibility and can also be used in combination with other resources.  note Quali has a vibrant developer’s community that is continuously developing new shells. Please browse it to see if we already have the shell you need. If we don’t, feel free to create or extend an existing shell, or propose a shell in our Idea box.

This version is the maximum supported Erlang for RabbitMq 3.12.0. Environment variables will be updated accordingly to suite the new Erlang version.\t2023.2 EA Python versions\tIn 2022.1, we updated CloudShell's Python versions as follows: 2.7.10 to 2.7.183.7.1 to 3.9.9 This may cause unexpected behavior if your automation is constrained to use specific Python versions.\t2022.1 EA API tokens\tTo increase security and to allow time-based token access to the system, CloudShell 2022.1 generates a time-based token for our product APIs. In previous versions, only some of the APIs used such a system. By default, the token validity period is 5 hours. Notes: For security reasons, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of CloudShell. Existing automation code utilizing Quali API may need to be updated to regenerate a token whenever an existing token expires. 2022.1 EA Reserve form\tThe Blueprint Name field in the Reserve form is no longer editable.\t2022.1 EA New Job Scheduling\tIn this CloudShell version, the Test Execution Servers use Robot Framework 4.0. As such, tests using an older version of the framework might not work as expected. For details, see this section in the Robot Framework 4.0 release notes.\t2022.1 EA Updated BI dashboards\tThe following out-of-the-box dashboards will be replaced by the new 2021.2 GA version (customized out-of-the-box dashboards will be left as is): Blueprints, Inventory, Sandboxes, Users, and Utilization. Viewer access is provided out-of-the-box, allowing CloudShell users to view and use the dashboards. Initial configuration, as well as the ability to add/customize dashboards and use legacy versions requires privileged access. For details, contact your Quali Account Manager.\t2021.2 GA New Job Scheduling\tFor security reasons, the Mongo deployment is no longer accessible outside the Kubernetes cluster and as a result does not get an external IP. However, external access can easily be configured using the externalAccess tag n the mongodb section of the customer-values-yaml. For details, see Upgrade Considerations for New Job Scheduling.\t2021.2 EA New Job Scheduling\tBefore upgrading from an earlier version, make sure to run the following on the Kubernetes client machine: kubectl delete secret cloudshell-acr -n cloudshell 2021.2 EA New Job Scheduling\tJob Scheduling Service needs to be restarted after 2021.2 EA upgrade. This only applies to 2021.2 EA version and will be fixed for the GA.\t2021.2 EA Blocking the option to link license pool to global domain\tWhen a user tries to attach a license pool to the Global domain they will now get a message stating that pools can't be associated with the global domain. This does not apply to existing associations of license pools with Global domain.\t2021.2 EA Periods no longer supported in abstract resource names\tAbstract resource names no longer support '.' (period) characters. Furthermore, importing blueprints will replace periods with underscores '_' in abstract resource names.\t2020.2 New CloudShell installation prerequisites\tAs of version 2020.2 we are moving some of our Sandbox related data to be managed and stored in Mongo DB instead of SQL Server. This allows CloudShell to drastically improve its performance, allowing hundreds of Sandbox reservation per minute. 2 new prerequisites are installed on Quali Sever: MongoDB RabbitMQ Quali Server's Installation Wizard and QsConfig have gone through some changes. New screens and some updated to existing screens have been added to the flow.\t2020.2 GA DB optimizations clean-ups\tData expiration is defined by default to be saved indefinitely. Admins can now define the time to keep sandbox event log data via the SandboxLogAndOutputSaveDuration configuration key.\t2020.2 GA &quot;In Use&quot; Sandbox overtime\tWhen using Job Scheduling, sandboxes will now end once all tests in the job are completed or the sandbox reaches its defined duration (the earlier of the two).

When importing resource families to CloudShell through Resource Manager Client, this issue is not enforced and an error message will not appear. However, referencing imported attributes whose names contain unsupported characters may cause unexpected behavior.\tBefore importing packages or the system.xml configuration file, review all attribute names. Using the packaging API, it is possible to add the following to a blueprint: shared sub-resources that are added to an unshared resource. This is not possible through the Resource Manager client. Using the API, when the config key “PickOnlyUsersFromLoggedInUserGroups” is set to “true”, the sandbox owner can be changed to a user which is outside of the user group of the current owner. When this key is set to &quot;true&quot; the changeowner API is not enforced by the key and the behavior is undefined. Using the API, when the config key “PickOnlyLoggedInUser” is set to “true”, the sandbox owner can be changed to a user other than himself. When this key is set to &quot;true&quot; the changeowner API is not enforced by the key and the behavior is undefined. The Linux Execution Server installation script fails when executed on a Linux operating system with an existing installation of Python 3 with symlink to usr/bin/python3.\t1. Remove the symlink from usr/bin/python3 by running the following cmd: rm –f /usr/bin/python3. 2. Run the Installation script again. In some cases, in the Job Scheduling dashboard, a suite's status may appear as &quot;in process&quot; while its jobs have already ended.\tIf you are experiencing this issue, please open a support ticket. When attempting to set a sandbox's data using the API command SetSandboxData from multiple sources at the same time, an error message is received intermittently.
