Chassis and controllers are each modeled by a dedicated shell. The separation of these two elements into different shells enables you to accurately model your real-life architecture. For example, they support scenarios where the chassis and controller are located on different machines or on the same one, provided as physical devices or software installed on VMs, and configurations that mix and match different controllers and chassis of the same manufacturer.

Import the traffic generator chassis shell into CloudShell. In the appropriate domain, create a chassis resource with the details of your chassis device or VM (if your chassis is provided as a virtual appliance). Import the traffic generator controller shell into CloudShell. Since the controller is a service, if you're not planning on working in the Global domain, you will need to expose the service to the appropriate domain. This is done by associating the service to a service category that is assigned to the domain. If your controller is a 1st Gen shell, in Resource Manager Client, open the Resource Families explorer, click the service family and associate the service category. For 2nd Gen service shells, assign the shell's service category to the appropriate domain in the Manage dashboard. Create a blueprint in the domain. Add the controller service, chassis ports that will be used in the traffic test, and any additional resources/Apps as appropriate. Create the connectivity requirements between the different endpoints. Associate the chassis ports to the port configurations specified in the controller's configuration file, as explained in the following section, under Load Configuration.

For additional commands and use cases, see the readme file that comes with your traffic generator shell.  In the sandbox, open the controller's commands pane. Run these commands in the following order: Run Load Configuration to load the configuration file prepared by your admin to the controller. The configuration file includes the settings according to which the traffic test will be run. For example, packet size, number of packets to send in parallel, interval at which to send packet batches, etc. Points to consider: The file must be accessible to the execution server that will run the traffic test.The configuration file provides a unique name for each port on the chassis. Therefore, in order to assign a port on the configuration file to a port on the chassis, you must specify the file's defined port name on the port in CloudShell. To do so, drag the port resource into the diagram from the Add Resource catalog, open its Resource Structure pane, click the port's drop-down list and select Attributes, and in the Logical Name field, specify the port's name. note Since traffic operations may take longer than the default 10 minute idle timeout period set for shell drivers, once you run the first command on the traffic generator controller, the controller will remain in a &quot;running&quot; state (indicated by the turning wheel on the controller service) until the reservation ends or the shell driver process is manually terminated. Run Start Traffic to generate and send the traffic to the DUT according to the settings provided in the configuration file. Set the Blocking input to decide how to run the traffic test (True to run synchronously or False to run asynchronously). In synchronous mode, CloudShell waits for the traffic test to complete before allowing additional traffic commands to run, and in asynchronous mode, you can run additional commands while the traffic test is running. Run Stop Traffic to stop sending traffic from the traffic generator. This does not terminate the controller's shell driver process, so if the Start Traffic command is running in synchronous mode, all subsequent commands will still have to wait for the traffic test to complete. Run Get Statistics. This command returns the traffic test's statistics in JSON or CSV format. Set the command's inputs: View Name: Type of statistics to return. For example, Port Statistics, Traffic Item Statistics, Flow Statistics, etc. The types available may differ depending on the traffic generator.Output Type (Enum): JSON or CSV. JSON prints the statistics to the reservation's output, which is useful for API calls that can then use the output, while CSV attaches a CSV file with the test's statistics to the sandbox.

Click the Permitted Users section and select the users you wish to add. To prevent users from ending the sandbox before its scheduled end time, enable Termination Protection. This option ensures your sandbox isn't ended accidentally or prematurely. And when you are ready to manually end the sandbox, disable the option in the sandbox's properties window and then end it. You can configure CloudShell to send email notifications to the owner of the sandbox and permitted users. note This capability requires the administrator to activate the email notifications feature using the ReservationEmail configuration keys.

Click Reserve. The sandbox is being reserved. If you are reserving a blueprint that has the Default Sandbox Setup script, the script runs, and an indication next to the sandbox state informs you of its progress. More details Note that during the Setup process, the sandbox is locked in CloudShell Portal and cannot be modified - see Unlocking sandboxes for use during the Setup process. The default setup process has 4 stages: Preparation - Prepare network connections for the sandbox's Apps and any additional custom preparations. note This stage is not used by default, but can be used for custom code executions that need to run before the setup process. Provisioning - This is the main stage of the setup process. In this stage, CloudShell locks unshared resources for the duration of the sandbox, deploys the sandbox's Apps and prepares App connectivity in the respective cloud providers. Connectivity - CloudShell creates the physical and virtual network connections for the sandbox's resources and Apps, and powers on the App VMs. Configuration - If any of the sandbox's Apps have configuration management operations that need to be run, CloudShell runs them in this stage. If any resource is unavailable for the scheduled time slot, the Conflicts dialog box is displayed, proposing an alternative time slot, as described in Dealing with conflicts. The new sandbox is displayed in Diagram view with a blue Sandbox label at the top of the canvas and a green Active icon in the toolbar: note For persistent blueprints, the blue Sandbox label is replaced with a Persistent Environment label.

This integration offers considerable time savings by automating the running and verification of your automation processes and tests through CloudShell sandboxes. note You may need to collaborate with different people in your organization to complete some of these tasks. To integrate CloudShell with your CI tool: Install the desired CloudShell CI plugin on your CI tool. Official CloudShell CI plugins such as Jenkins and TeamCity are available in Quali Repositories. Configure the CloudShell connection details on your CI tool, as explained in the plugin's documentation. Design a blueprint that suits your CI process. Make sure the blueprint's Setup script includes all the automation that is required for the test. For details, see CloudShell Dev Guide's CloudShell's OOB Orchestration.In addition, the CI tool must wait for the sandbox's setup process to complete before running the test. Note that CloudShell's Default Sandbox Setup script provides this functionality. Create your first build in the CI tool, as detailed in the plugin's documentation. This includes specifying the blueprint's name, duration, inputs, and any optional details, as appropriate. note CloudShell CI plugins only work with public blueprints. tip Use the Stop Sandbox functionality that is provided by the CloudShell CI plugin to automatically free up your sandbox's resources once the automation process or test completes. Run the build to make sure that it works. Make sure the CI tool waits for the sandbox's setup process to complete before running the test. This is done automatically by Setup scripts that are based on CloudShell's Default Sandbox Setup script. Make sure a new sandbox is created in CloudShell with the specified configurations. Add your custom automation process or test to the CI build, using your preferred plugin language. The CloudShell CI plugin populates the sandbox's details in the build so it can be used in your automation process or test. Rerun your build to verify the end-to-end flow. Now that the build is fully configured, you can add it to your CI workflow and monitor the results.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Changing the Language in CloudShell Portal","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/cloudshell-help/next/portal/overview/change-language","content":"Changing the Language in CloudShell Portal This article explains how to change the display language of CloudShell Portal.

In this scenario, the Salesforce service doesn’t have to be an element in any sandbox. This is done by creating a CloudShell service shell that contains all the relevant attributes, automation and logic required to access and use the cloud service. For this purpose, we’ve created the Cloud Service Shell Standard, which provides the framework for implementing support for cloud services.

See Customizing Shells. Package and install the shell on CloudShell. See Packaging and importing a Shell into CloudShell. Expose the shell to the relevant domains.

When deleting a saved sandbox, CloudShell deletes (from the vCenter or OpenStack server) all artifacts related to that saved sandbox and only then deletes the saved sandbox artifacts from CloudShell.  For example, if you finished working on a sandbox, and would like to continue working on it later on, you can save the sandbox and return to it without losing any of your work.

To add resources to the blueprint.  In the blueprint workspace, click Resources. From the Add Resource catalog, drag the resources you need into the canvas. Our catalog has two resources, DUT and Traffic Generator, but you can use the free text search field or Advanced search to fine tune your search if you have a lot of resources. Each new blueprint includes CloudShell's out-of-the-box orchestration scripts that set up and tear down the environment. The Setup script provisions the resources to the sandbox, resolves reservation conflicts, deploys App VMs and establishes connections between the sandbox's endpoints.

Then, click the other resource. In the Resource Connections dialog box, from the Connection Type dropdown list, select Route (Logical) to create a L1 connection or Connector for a L2 connection. Select a port on the source resource and one on the target and click Add. Repeat this step to add additional connection routes. Click Save. Physical routes are represented by black dotted lines between the resources, as illustrated in the image below. Notes: If a connection route is purple, that’s because you defined a Connector type of a connection. This is used for L2 connections and will fail unless you have an L2 resource orvCenter dvSwitch connecting the endpoints. Edit the route connection to open the Resource Connections dialog box, click the Inventory tab in the dialog box, delete the connections and create new ones.If you defined an L1 connection in the blueprint but the connection line is orange, that’s because there’s no L1 switch resource connecting the endpoints. Notify the administrator. At this point, they’re just connection requirements. When the sandbox starts, CloudShell will activate the connections, replacing the dotted lines with solid ones.

Multiple execution servers can be installed for distributed provisioning.  Make sure the machine(s) that will host CloudShell comply with our CloudShell System Requirements. info CloudShell’s servers and clients can coexist on the same machine, but for load/performance reasons, you might want to consider installing high-load components such as Quali Server, CloudShell Portal and the Execution Servers on dedicated machines. Install and configure CloudShell suite. For details, see CloudShell Suite Installation Overview. You can also install CloudShell in a High Availability configuration. We highly recommend using CloudShell’s Insight, our BI platform.

A domain is basically a space that includes the resources, Apps and blueprints that apply to a specific team, project or geographically-distributed site in your organization, and the users that belong to that team or site.  Groups are the link that connects users to a domain. Each group has a role, which is delegated to that group’s members in the domain. As such, you could have a single user with different roles in different domains. That user could be a “regular user” in one domain but a “domain admin” in another.

For details on how to create these components, see the related topics section that follows.  Each one of these components is based on a shell, which is a plugin that defines how the component will behave in the sandbox. A shell models a specific component, so if we want to create a Juniper switch, we’ll need a Juniper switch shell and to deploy or load a Google Cloud VM, we’ll need a shell that can do that. To quickly see how CloudShell works, we recommend using our PUT and Traffic Generator mock shells.  CloudShell supports 4 types of components:  Resource models an actual physical or virtual device. It could be a layer 2 Cisco switch or some existing virtual appliance on the cloud that you’d like to load into CloudShell. Feel free to use our PUT Shell Mock and Traffic Shell Mock resources.App is the definition of virtual application to be deployed as part of the sandbox. It defines the VM to be deployed and configuration management script or playbook that will install the application(s) on top of the VM. Apps live in the context of a sandbox and when the sandbox ends, CloudShell’s teardown script will also delete the VM from the cloud.Service is a sandbox component that injects some code into the sandbox. It could be used to register to a cloud-based service like a traffic generator on Azure.Abstract resource is a component that includes the settings you need from a specific resource. When the blueprint is reserved, CloudShell finds a matching resource in the CloudShell inventory and puts it in the blueprint instead of the abstract. Abstract resources provide the blueprint with additional flexibility and can also be used in combination with other resources.  note Quali has a vibrant developer’s community that is continuously developing new shells. Please browse it to see if we already have the shell you need. If we don’t, feel free to create or extend an existing shell, or propose a shell in our Idea box.

This version is the maximum supported Erlang for RabbitMq 3.12.0. Environment variables will be updated accordingly to suite the new Erlang version.\t2023.2 EA Python versions\tIn 2022.1, we updated CloudShell's Python versions as follows: 2.7.10 to 2.7.183.7.1 to 3.9.9 This may cause unexpected behavior if your automation is constrained to use specific Python versions.\t2022.1 EA API tokens\tTo increase security and to allow time-based token access to the system, CloudShell 2022.1 generates a time-based token for our product APIs. In previous versions, only some of the APIs used such a system. By default, the token validity period is 5 hours. Notes: For security reasons, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of CloudShell. Existing automation code utilizing Quali API may need to be updated to regenerate a token whenever an existing token expires. 2022.1 EA Reserve form\tThe Blueprint Name field in the Reserve form is no longer editable.\t2022.1 EA New Job Scheduling\tIn this CloudShell version, the Test Execution Servers use Robot Framework 4.0. As such, tests using an older version of the framework might not work as expected. For details, see this section in the Robot Framework 4.0 release notes.\t2022.1 EA Updated BI dashboards\tThe following out-of-the-box dashboards will be replaced by the new 2021.2 GA version (customized out-of-the-box dashboards will be left as is): Blueprints, Inventory, Sandboxes, Users, and Utilization. Viewer access is provided out-of-the-box, allowing CloudShell users to view and use the dashboards. Initial configuration, as well as the ability to add/customize dashboards and use legacy versions requires privileged access. For details, contact your Quali Account Manager.\t2021.2 GA New Job Scheduling\tFor security reasons, the Mongo deployment is no longer accessible outside the Kubernetes cluster and as a result does not get an external IP. However, external access can easily be configured using the externalAccess tag n the mongodb section of the customer-values-yaml. For details, see Upgrade Considerations for New Job Scheduling.\t2021.2 EA New Job Scheduling\tBefore upgrading from an earlier version, make sure to run the following on the Kubernetes client machine: kubectl delete secret cloudshell-acr -n cloudshell 2021.2 EA New Job Scheduling\tJob Scheduling Service needs to be restarted after 2021.2 EA upgrade. This only applies to 2021.2 EA version and will be fixed for the GA.\t2021.2 EA Blocking the option to link license pool to global domain\tWhen a user tries to attach a license pool to the Global domain they will now get a message stating that pools can't be associated with the global domain. This does not apply to existing associations of license pools with Global domain.\t2021.2 EA Periods no longer supported in abstract resource names\tAbstract resource names no longer support '.' (period) characters. Furthermore, importing blueprints will replace periods with underscores '_' in abstract resource names.\t2020.2 New CloudShell installation prerequisites\tAs of version 2020.2 we are moving some of our Sandbox related data to be managed and stored in Mongo DB instead of SQL Server. This allows CloudShell to drastically improve its performance, allowing hundreds of Sandbox reservation per minute. 2 new prerequisites are installed on Quali Sever: MongoDB RabbitMQ Quali Server's Installation Wizard and QsConfig have gone through some changes. New screens and some updated to existing screens have been added to the flow.\t2020.2 GA DB optimizations clean-ups\tData expiration is defined by default to be saved indefinitely. Admins can now define the time to keep sandbox event log data via the SandboxLogAndOutputSaveDuration configuration key.\t2020.2 GA &quot;In Use&quot; Sandbox overtime\tWhen using Job Scheduling, sandboxes will now end once all tests in the job are completed or the sandbox reaches its defined duration (the earlier of the two).

When reserving a blueprint that has an abstract resource, CloudShell will find resources that meet the resource requirements and are available for the time slot of the sandbox, and add them to the sandbox. You cannot add abstract resources directly to a sandbox, only to the blueprint. Blueprints can contain a mixture of abstract and specific resources.

CloudShell will only select resources that fully match this criteria. You must select the resource family but you can include any combination of the rest of the requirements in your abstract resource.  Note: As you add or update your requirements, CloudShell updates the number of matching inventory resources in the top right corner of the abstract resource dialog box.  Family (mandatory)Quantity: number of resources to selectSharing policyModel: model or models within the selected familyAttribute valuesSub-resources: sub-resource settings, such as blades, ports, attribute values on each sub-resource  Additional info:  Additional info is information you can add to the abstract resource for automation processes and to make available for the sandbox end-user. For example, you may want to save the resource firmware version, which needs to be upgraded as part of the sandbox provisioning process. Another example could be referencing the image file location of the resource.  Attribute values  Domains:  The domains in which this abstract resource can be used. By default, the current domain is selected and cannot be removed from the abstract resource.
