# Job Scheduling Portal

The Job Scheduling Portal is the web UI in which you create and manage your suites and suite executions. The Job Scheduling Portal is a dedicated client for the **New Job Scheduling** and is not accessible via CloudShell Portal.

It has three pages:

- **Job Scheduling** where you create and manage your suites and suite executions
- **REST API** provides you with access to the live documentation pages where you can try out our API
- **Job Scheduling Servers** lists the available Test Execution Servers, displays their status and provides several admin management options
