# Running Custom Suite Executions

You can run a modified version of an existing suite template using the **Custom Run** button that is displayed to the right of each suite in the **New Job Scheduling** dashboard. Custom suite executions behave the same as regular executions and include test execution reports as well as the option of creating or linking Jira issues to different test executions.

**To run a custom suite:**

1. In the **New Job Scheduling** dashboard, click the suite's **Custom Run** button.

2. Modify the suite, as appropriate.
    
    You can change the suite's name and details, as well as modify, add and remove jobs and tests.

3. Click **Run** and then click **OK** in the confirmation popup.
    
    Unlike regular suite executions that only display the execution's number, custom executions display both their name and execution number. For example:
