# Packaging API

The packaging API automates the creation and configuration of CloudShell blueprint packages. Using packages, blueprints can be shared between CloudShell deployments and exported locally for backup purposes. With the packaging API, you can also create new blueprints and modify the settings and data model (families, models, attributes, drivers, etc.) of new or existing blueprints before packaging. For details, see [Getting Started with Packaging API](./get-start-with-pkg-api.md).

A package is a zip file that includes a set of folders and files that can be imported into a CloudShell database by using the web portal or by calling the Quali REST API.

To learn more about the contents of the blueprint package, see [Exporting a Blueprint Package](../../portal/blueprints/creating-blueprints/export-blueprints/export-a-package.md).
