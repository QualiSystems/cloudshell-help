# Blueprints

A blueprint is an offline sandbox template. It contains physical and virtual resources, connections and configurations. The Blueprints Catalog displays your own private blueprints as well as public blueprints available within domains you are permitted to access. Here you can manage your blueprints and their contents, and reserve them (i.e. bring them live).
