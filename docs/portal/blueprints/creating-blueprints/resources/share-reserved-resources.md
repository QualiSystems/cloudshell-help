# Share Reserved Resources

You can configure resources to be available or unavailable for other sandboxes by choosing to share or unshare them. The default share status of a resource is determined by its family's **Locked by Default** check box in the Resource Manager Client's **Resource Families** explorer.

:::note Notes:
- When you reserve an unshared resource, all its sub-resources become unshared in the sandbox.
- To override the share setting for a specific resource, edit the resource's default share level in the Inventory dashboard. For more details, see [Editing Resources from the Inventory Dashboard](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/INVN/Edit-Rsrc-in-Invnt.htm).
:::
**To share or unshare a resource:**

1. In **Diagram** view, hover over the resource. The **Actions** menu is displayed.
    
    In **List** view, in the required resource's row, click the **Actions** menu.
    
2. Select **Share/Unshare**.
