# Add Resources

You can add resources to the blueprint and to the sandbox.

**To add a resource:**

1. In **Diagram** view, in the sandbox toolbar, click **Resource**.
    
    The **Add Resource** pane is displayed.
    
2. Use the search and filtering options to find the sub resource(s) you want to use. See [Find Resources](../../../sandboxes/sandbox-workspace/resources/find-resources.md).
3. Drag the required resource to the workspace.
    
    :::note
    - You can reserve any of the resource's sub-resources for the duration of the sandbox. See [Configure Sub-resources](../../../sandboxes/sandbox-workspace/resources/configure-sub-resources.md).
    - You can control the size of the icons in the workspace. The setting is maintained for all users in the domain after reserving the blueprint.
