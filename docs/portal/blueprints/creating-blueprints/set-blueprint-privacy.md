# Set the Blueprint's Privacy (Public / Private)

The blueprint's privacy setting determines who can see it in the Blueprint Catalog. The **Blueprint Catalog** displays private blueprints that you own and public blueprints in your domain. By default, new blueprints are private.

If you want to allows specific users to work on a sandbox that is created from a private blueprint, add them as Permitted Users to the sandbox. This is especially useful if you're developing a blueprint and want to get feedback from others.
