# Add Resources

You can add resources to the blueprint and to the sandbox.

To add a resource:

1. In Diagram view, in the sandbox toolbar, click Resource.
    
    The Add Resource pane is displayed.
    
2. Use the search and filtering options to find the sub resource(s) you want to use. See [Find Resources](./find-resources.md).
3. Drag the required resource to the workspace.
    
    :::note Notes
    - You can reserve any of the resource's sub-resources for the duration of the sandbox. See [Configure Sub-resources](./configure-sub-resources.md).
    - You can control the size of the icons in the workspace. The setting is maintained for all users in the domain after reserving the blueprint.
