# Delete an App From the Sandbox

This procedure explains how to delete Apps from a sandbox. This action also disconnects the App's connections to other components, removes the deployed App from the inventory, powers off the App's virtual machine (VM) and deletes it from the cloud provider.

:::note
VM resources that were not deployed by a CloudShell App, like static VMs that were loaded into CloudShell, are not deleted from the cloud provider.
:::

**To delete an App:**

1. Open the sandbox diagram.
2. Hover over the App. From the context menu, select the **Remove** option.
