# Physical Network Connectivity Prerequisites

The connectivity requests you make in CloudShell must reflect the physical resource connections you have in your network. Therefore, before you start creating connections, make sure your system administrator properly set up the physical layer and Virtual Networks, if they are to be used for resource connectivity as well.

## Set up the Physical Layer

For connectivity using virtual networks, see [VLAN Connectivity](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnct-Ctrl-VLAN.htm).

The physical layer comprises the switches and patch panels that actually connect your blueprint's resources to one another. When setting up these components, the administrator needs to define each L1 switch and patch panel's connectivity options, ports, etc. For additional information, see the following sections:
