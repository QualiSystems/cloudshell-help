# Physical Network Connectivity

The following articles explain how to set up, configure and manage resource connectivity requirements in the blueprint or sandbox using L1 switches and patch panels. Virtual networks can also be used for connectivity involving resources as well as Apps - see [VLAN Connectivity](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnct-Ctrl-VLAN.htm) and [Subnet Connectivity](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnct-Ctrl-Subnets.htm) to learn how to configure these networks. For information about creating and configuring virtual networks for endpoints in the diagram, see [Virtual Network Connectivity](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/App-Cnct/Vir-Ntwrk-Cnct-Cntnr.htm).
