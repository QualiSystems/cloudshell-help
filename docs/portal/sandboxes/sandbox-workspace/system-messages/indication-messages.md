# Indication Messages

Indication messages about the blueprint, sandbox and resources pop up at the top of the web portal. This includes messages for the status of different actions and errors CloudShell encounters.

For example:

When creating a new blueprint:

![](/Images/CloudShell-Portal/Lab-Management/Reservations/IndicationMessage1.png)

When running a resource command:

![](/Images/CloudShell-Portal/Lab-Management/Reservations/IndicationMessage2.png)
