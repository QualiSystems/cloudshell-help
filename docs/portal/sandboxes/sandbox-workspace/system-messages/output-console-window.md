# Output Console Window

The Output console displays information related to blueprint and resource commands that are running in the sandbox. The last 10 output messages are displayed in the console. By default, the console window opens whenever a new sandbox event occurs, but the admin can change this behavior using the `AutoOpenCommandOutputOnNewEvents` configuration key.
