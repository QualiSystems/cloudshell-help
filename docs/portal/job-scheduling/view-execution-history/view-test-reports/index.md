# Viewing Test Reports

This section explains how to view the execution report for a specific test. Execution reports provide information about the test including general information, start and end times, and execution information such as errors that occurred and test measurements. The execution report can be saved as a PDF.

:::note
By default, the report is displayed using the TestÂ Results report template, but administrators can change the default template using the `DefaultReportTemplate` key, as explained in [Setting the Test Execution Report Template for Automation Suite Tests](../view-test-reports/setting-test-execution-report-template.md).
