# Inventory Dashboard

The **Inventory** dashboard details all the physical and virtual resources, abstract templates, services, and Apps you are permitted to access. In this dashboard, you can view and manage the inventory and directly connect to different resources (e.g. using RDP, SSH, VNC, or Telnet).

Management operations require administrator privileges. Non-administrators can only view items in the **Inventory** dashboard.
