# Searching the Inventory

![](/Images/CloudShell-Portal/Lab-Management/Working-with-the-Inventory/InventSearchingInventory.png)

The search options in the **Inventory** dashboard differ depending on the Inventory page (**Resources**, **Abstract Templates**, and **Services**). The search is very similar to the sandbox and blueprint search functionality and includes all resources in the inventory for all users of the current domain. For additional information, see [Find Resources](../sandboxes/sandbox-workspace/resources/find-resources.md).
:::note
In the **Resources** page of the dashboard, to sort the items in the list, click the desired column name. You can sort by name, address, family and model, or attributes. You can also control the width of each column.
