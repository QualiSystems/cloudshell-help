# Deleting Resources from the Inventory

This article explains how to delete resources and App VMs from CloudShell's inventory. This action also powers off the App's virtual machine (VM) and deletes it from the cloud provider.

:::note
VM resources that were not deployed by a CloudShell App, like static VMs that were loaded into CloudShell, are not deleted from the cloud provider.
