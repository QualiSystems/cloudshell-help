# Searching for Sub-resources

It is possible to search a resource for sub-resources, such as ports.

**To search within a resource:**

    The **Resources** page is displayed.
    
2. From the **Actions** menu, select **Search Within**.
    
    The search resource page is displayed and the resource's sub-resources are listed.
    
    For additional information about the search options, see [Find Resources](../../sandboxes/sandbox-workspace/resources/find-resources.md).
