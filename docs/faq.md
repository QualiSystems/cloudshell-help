# Frequently Asked Questions

**Does CloudShell physically interact with devices and cloud providers?**

Yes. CloudShell communicates with and runs automation on physical devices and enables spinning up dedicated VMs as part of the sandbox lifecycle. This requires a shell that is able to both access the device and run the required automation.

**Where can I find shells that I can use in CloudShell?**

[Quali Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/QualiSystems/discussions/categories/integrations) page includes hundreds of shells and plugins that have been developed by Quali community developers.

**Can I create my own shells?**

Yes. To assist you with this, we've created the [The CloudShell DevGuide](./devguide/), which provides step-by-step instructions and implementation examples for shell, cloud provider and script development.

**Can CloudShell integrate with common DevOps tools?**

Yes. You can design your own integration or search [Quali Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/QualiSystems/discussions/categories/integrations) for a suitable plugin, such as the [CloudShell Sandbox Jenkins Plugin](https://community.quali.com/repos/2033/cloudshell-sandbox-jenkins-plugin) and [CloudShell TeamCity Plugin](https://community.quali.com/repos/527/cluodshell-teamcity-plugin). For additional information, see [Consuming Sandboxes as Part of Continuous Integration Workflows](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/Flows/Flws-CI-Intg.htm).

**Can I use as many Execution Servers as I want?**

Yes. You may install and use as many Execution Servers as you'd like. For example, you could dedicate Execution Servers for different teams in your organization or for geographically distributed sites. Note that CloudShell Execution Servers do not require a purchased license.

**Can I choose which Execution Server will be used for each resource?**

Yes. CloudShell allows linking specific Execution Servers to resources, Apps, services and blueprints. For additional information, see [Setting Up Execution Servers to Run Commands](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Tst-n-Cmd-Exc.htm).
