## Planning to upgrade?

:::note
Starting with version 2020.2, sandbox events data is stored on MongoDB. As such, upgrade from an earlier CloudShell version may take longer than usual while this data is being copied from SQL Server to MongoDB.

Please reach out to your Technical Account Manager for full upgrade support.
