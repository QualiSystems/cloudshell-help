## Planning to upgrade?

:::note
Starting with version 2020.2, sandbox events data is stored on MongoDB. As such, upgrade from an earlier CloudShell version may take longer than usual while this data is being copied from SQL Server to MongoDB.
:::

Please reach out to your Technical Account Manager for full upgrade support.

You can upgrade to CloudShell 2023.3 from any CloudShell version [that is under support](./supported-versions.md) (either Premier or Extended support phases). To upgrade from a version that is no longer supported, contact your Technical Account Manager.

Before performing an upgrade, please make sure to review the [CloudShell System Requirements](../install-configure/cs-system-requirements/index.md) and [Known Upgrade Issues](../install-configure/cloudshell-suite/appendix/known-upgrade-issues.md).

Please make sure to review the [General Announcements](./general-announcments.md) , [Bugs Fixed](./bug-fixes.md) and [Behavior Changes and Removed Capabilities](./behavior-change.md) sections of this release.
