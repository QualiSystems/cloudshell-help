# Known Limitations

This section describes known limitations of CloudShell , as well as possible workarounds for these issues when available.

| Issue | Solution/Workaround | Discovered in | Internal WI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Irrelevant error message to restart session appears when reserving a persistent sandbox which has conflicts | Together with a relevant message about the conflict another error appears asking to restart the session. This message can be ignored. | 2023.2 | 13743 |
| **Export routes as csv** does not include routs that are connected to abstract resources. |   | 2023.2 | 12586 |
| The blueprint's Approval settings are currently not included when exporting the blueprint package. |   | 2023.1 | 11273 |
| When reserving a blueprint from CloudShell Portal, triangle quotes \<\> are not supported in blueprint string inputs. Attempting to reserve a blueprint with such a value will fail. <br/>**Note:** This limitation only applies when reserving blueprints from CloudShell Portal; There is no issue with passing this value via API.::: |   | 2022.2 | 53747 (support ticket) |
| Due to an issue with C++ Redistributable installation, Sandbox API gateway configuration fails with the following error: <br/> ERROR WatchdogProcessManager - Process '"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\QualiSystems\\CloudShell\\SandboxApiGateway\\win64\\bin\\httpd.exe"' has exited with code -1073741515. | Manually install the redistributable, from this folder:<br/>CloudShell 2022.2 GA \[2022.2.0.1470\]\\Data\\Prereq\\visual c++ runtime 17.0\\vcredist\_x86\\VC\_redist.x86.exe | 2022.2 | 9906 |
| For sandboxes that were extended beyond the limits of the user/blueprint, for example by the admin. There will be some known issues:<br/>- The properties page will show the time limited to what the user itself can actually reserve.<br/>- End-users trying to update any of the sandbox properties may shorten the time of the sandbox to the end-user's maximum allowed duration. This will happen if the user made the update before their allowed duration was surpassed. However, if the sandbox has been running for longer than the user's allowed duration, the sandbox duration will not be changed.<br/>**Note**: In previous versions, a user would fail to save the sandbox properties changes with a ‘historic date’ error message. |   | 2022.1 | 51227 (support ticket) |
| L1 drivers functionality may fail for customers upgrading to 2022.1 | If you upgraded to CS 2022.1 and above and your L1 isn’t working, please see [L1 functionality isn’t working (2022.1 and above)](../troubleshooting/quali-server/l1-functionality-isn’t-working-2022.1-and-above.md). | 2022.1 | 51346 (support ticket) |

| In the following scenario, external users can promote a draft. Regular users that are permitted editors in a blueprint draft remain permitted editors even after their role changes to external user. This issue relates to the new [What's New in Version 2023.3](../release-notes/whats-new.md) feature that was implemented in 2022.1. |   | 2022.1 | 185327 |
| Adding a deployed App resource from a different reservation may sometimes cause the Robot Page to appear when opening the deployed App resource's **Application Commands** pane. |   | 2022.1 | 185187 |
| Service asset is added but not associated to the service model when imported from blueprint: When importing a blueprint that contains services, repository assets that are associated to the services are added to CloudShell without the association to the services. | After importing the blueprint, associate the service models to the repository assets, as appropriate. | 2022.1 | 185105 |
| Setup scripts that use global inputs with empty spaces before or after the input value may sometimes fail. |   | 2022.1 | 184029 |

| Azure Integration: For Blueprints that have 2 Azure apps with P2P connectivity, reservation fails when both apps have "Add Public IP" set to _True_. | Instead of using a peer-to-peer connection, add a subnet and connect both apps to the subnet. | 2020.2 |   |
| Unstable issue: During the Quali Server configuration a false-positive 'Failed to install CloudShell RabbitMQ Service' warning message may appear during an initial stage of the CloudShell installation. | Click **OK** and continue with the installation flow. | 2020.2 |   |

| If you are using the New Job Scheduling service, you will not be able to change the domain names. This is due to the fact that when changing the domain name, the suite data should remain available. |   | 2020.2 |   |
| When the MongoDB Collection name contains any of the following special characters, the MongoDB configuration fails and a 'an unknown error occurred' pop-up message is displayed: ".\<\>\\$\*|  | Do not include and of the following special characters in the MongoDB collection: ".\<\>\\$\*|  | 2020.2 |   |
| Unstable Issue: Under high load of concurrent sandbox-creation requests, an active sandbox with conflict is created instead of presenting the conflicts in a pop-up window. |   | 2020.2 |   |
| When reserving a blueprint with excluded resource(s), the sandbox will not be reserved but the excluded resources will not be listed in the 'resources in conflict' list. |   | 2020.2 |   |

| The Sandboxes dashboard does not support searching by partial sandbox ID. |   | 2020.1 | 181588 |
| For customers who are: <br/>1. Upgrading from CloudShell version 9.0 or earlier to version 9.1 or later  <br/>\-and-<br/>2. Have blueprints that contain abstract resources with published attributes  <br/>\-and-<br/>3. Are using Job Scheduling<br/>Job suites with published inputs using above mentioned blueprints will fail and all published inputs may be lost. | 1. Upgrade to the latest available CloudShell version only.<br/>2. Contact your Technical Account Manager to perform a required manual update to all job suites. | 9.3 |   |

| In Resource Manager client, when editing the "Max Scheduled Sandboxes” for a user multiple times, the last valid value is saved. | Enter a numeric value only |   |   |
| In the Job Scheduling dashboard, when the user attempts to run a test suite during which the user exceeds the maximum number of scheduled sandboxes s/he’s permitted to schedule, a wrong error message is displayed in the cancelled job. | The user should avoid exceeding his/her permitted number of sandboxes. |   |   |
| Resource, App and Service attribute names can contain alphanumeric characters and spaces only. When importing resource families to CloudShell through Resource Manager Client, this issue is not enforced and an error message will not appear. However, referencing imported attributes whose names contain unsupported characters may cause unexpected behavior. | Before importing packages or the system.xml configuration file, review all attribute names. |   |   |
| Using the packaging API, it is possible to add the following to a blueprint: shared sub-resources that are added to an unshared resource. This is not possible through the Resource Manager client. |   |   |   |
| Using the API, when the config key "PickOnlyUsersFromLoggedInUserGroups” is set to "true”, the sandbox owner can be changed to a user which is outside of the user group of the current owner. When this key is set to "true" the changeowner API is not enforced by the key and the behavior is undefined. |   |   |   |
| Using the API, when the config key "PickOnlyLoggedInUser” is set to "true”, the sandbox owner can be changed to a user other than himself. When this key is set to "true" the changeowner API is not enforced by the key and the behavior is undefined. |   |   |   |

Remove the symlink from usr/bin/python3 by running the following cmd: `rm –f /usr/bin/python3`.<br/>2. Run the Installation script again. |   |   |
| In some cases, in the Job Scheduling dashboard, a suite's status may appear as "in process" while its jobs have already ended. | If you are experiencing this issue, please open a support ticket. |   |   |
| When attempting to set a sandbox's data using the API command _SetSandboxData_ from multiple sources at the same time, an error message is received intermittently. |   |   |   |
