    If you're using CloudShell without the New Job Scheduling, the password update is automatic and should take a few moments.
    
2. If your CloudShell deployment uses the New Job Scheduling, set the new password on the different services, as explained in [Modify the CloudShell Admin Password](../new-jss-install-config/admin-actions/modify-cs-admin-pass.md).

## PyPi Server Credentials

1. Click the **PyPi Server Credentials** button to configure the PyPi Server access credentials.
