# Install CloudShell

You can perform the full installation of the CloudShell Suite or, optionally, while running the installation procedure, you can choose to install one or more of the CloudShell Suite components.

The Installation wizard checks for missing prerequisite components as part of the installation process. For example, the installation wizard prompts you to install .NET Framework 4.6.1 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Runtime if they are not already installed.

When installing or upgrading your production environment, make sure to also review [Best Practices for CloudShell Production Environment](../../appendix/best-practices-cs-prod/index.md).
