# Download CloudShell Installation Files

The installation packages for CloudShell are available in [CloudShell Download Center](https://support.quali.com/hc/en-us/articles/231613247-Quali-s-Download-Center).

For each file you can find the associated .md5 checksum which enables you to verify its authenticity.

Extract the installation zip file to a temporary directory, ensuring a short path (e.g., c:\\temp), to prevent potential Windows limitation issues related to maximum path lengths.
