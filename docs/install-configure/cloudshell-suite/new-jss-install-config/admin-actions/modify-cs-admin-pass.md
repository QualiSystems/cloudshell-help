# Modify the CloudShell Admin Password

*For details about changing the Quali Server service's running user, see* [Changing the Running User on the Quali Server Service](../../configure-products/change-service-user.md).

If you need to change the CloudShell system administrator password, you must register the new password with the New Job Scheduling. If you donâ€™t do this, you will not be able to access the Job Scheduling Portal and REST API with this user.
:::note
This procedure only applies to deployments that use the New Job Scheduling. In CloudShell deployments without the New Job Scheduling, the password update is automatic.
:::
:::tip
This procedure assumes you are storing your passwords in plain text. However, you can use a Kubernetes secret instead, to safeguard your passwords as well as other sensitive data on the Kubernetes cluster. For details, see [Customize the Deployment Configuration Parameters](../high-level-install-flow/customize-deployment/customize-deployment-config-params.md).
:::
**To register the new admin password with the New Job Scheduling:**

1. Run the Quali Server configuration wizard and set the new password. For details, see [Admin Configuration Settings](../../configure-products/admin-config-settings.md).
2. Open the `~\Server\SndboxService\Customer.yaml` file, and set the password:
    
    ```css
    quali_server:
        host: 'localhost'
        port: 8029
        password: <new-admin-password>
    ```
    
3. Include the following parameters in the `customer.values.yaml` file with the new password:
    
    ```css
    identity-service:
      identityService:
        env:
          AppSettings__CloudShell__Password: <new-admin-password>
    job-scheduling-service:
      jobSchedulingService:
        env:
          CloudShell__Password: <new-admin-password>
    sandbox-service:
      sandboxService:
        env:
          SBS__QUALI_SERVER__PASSWORD: <new-admin-password>
    ```
    
4. Save the file.
5. Redeploy the CloudShell helm chart.
