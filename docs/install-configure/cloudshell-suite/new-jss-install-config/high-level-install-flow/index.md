# High-level installation flow

The New Job Scheduling uses a microservices architecture, which includes several services, each deployed over a scalable group of containers that are hosted on a Kubernetes cluster. This infrastructure is deployed using Helm, which is a modern orchestration platform for deploying microservices-based software on Kubernetes.

In order to deploy the New Job Scheduling, you will need the following:

- kubectl Kubernetes management utility installed on a client machine and configured with admin access on the Kubernetes cluster. For details on the required Kubernetes cluster configuration, see [Requirements (New Job Scheduling)](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/IG/JSS/jss-prerequisites.htm).
    
- Helm CLI tool installed on the kubectl machine
    
- CloudShell.tgz Helm package. Please download from [Qualiâ€™s Download Center](https://support.quali.com/hc/en-us/articles/231613247-Quali-s-Download-Center).
    

The high-level installation flow is as follows:
