# HighÂ Availability

A failover cluster is a group of independent servers (nodes) that work together to increase the availability and scalability of clustered nodes. The clustered nodes are connected by physical cables and by software. If a disaster occurs and the active cluster node goes down, the clustering solution changes the active node automatically to the standby server and the Quali Server starts on the new active node.
