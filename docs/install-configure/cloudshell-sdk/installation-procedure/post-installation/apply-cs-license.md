# Applying the CloudShell License

**To remotely access CloudShell portal and apply the CloudShell license:**

1. Open a browser on a networked machine and specify the URL based on the IP of the newly created VM. To find the IP, log in to the VM, open command-line and run the `ipconfig` command.
    
    The VM does not have a CloudShell license and therefore the **Activate CloudShell** page is displayed.

2. In the **Enter Activation Key** field, enter the CloudShell activation key you downloaded from the CloudShell SDK download page. Make sure you include the full license string, starting with the words "Quali\_Community\_SDK".
    
3. Click ![](/Images/SDK2/ApplyingTheCloudShellLicense_2_141x31.png).

5. In the Login screen, enter the default user credentials (Username: "admin", Password: "admin") and select the time zone.
6. Click **Login**.
    
    When the procedure completes, Cloudshell is set to run in a standalone configuration.
