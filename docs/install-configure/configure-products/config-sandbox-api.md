# Configure CloudShell Sandbox API

The CloudShell Sandbox API service is installed by the CloudShell Installation wizard (as described in [Install CloudShell Sandbox API](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/IG/Complete%20Installation/instl-cs-sndbox-api.htm)). Since CloudShell Sandbox API is a service, you can install it on the same machine as the CloudShell Portal/Quali Server or on a different machine, and also install it on several machines (and can configure the settings accordingly). Having multiple Sandbox API services is useful if you have security issues and donâ€™t want to allow connectivity from other automation clients to Quali Server or for scenarios where you have multiple Continuous Integration servers in different parts of the lab consuming sandboxes.
:::note
The default port for the CloudShell Sandbox API in the Quali Server is 82. You can customize this port number, as required.
:::
**To customize the port settings for accessing the CloudShell Sandbox API:**

1. In the CloudShell Configuration Wizard, click **CloudShell Sandbox API** to open a web page, where you can customize the **Port Number** for accessing the API to suit your needs.

2. When the CloudShell Sandbox API is installed on a different machine than the CloudShell Portal, in the **Quali Server Address** field, you can specify the host name or IP address of the Quali Server.
3. Click **Save** to save the settings. (If you wish to revert the settings, click **Revert**.)
