# Server Connectivity Settings

**To configure server connectivity settings:**

1. In the **Server Connectivity** window, specify the hostname or IP address of the Quali Server and your login settings.
    
    For example, in the CloudShell Portal Configuration Wizard:
    
    ![](/Images/IG2/Configuring-the-database-connection_13.png)
    
2. Specify the connection credentials to use for connecting to the application server.
3. Enter the name or IP of the computer where Quali Server is installed. If the server is installed locally, use localhost as the server name.
    
    The default login settings are:
    
    **Username**: admin
    
    **Password**: admin
    
    For details how to change the username and/or the password, see [Admin password](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/IG/Configure%20CloudShell%20Products/admn-cnfgr-stgs.htm#_Admin_password).
