# Configure the Remaining Cluster Nodes

**To configure the rest of the cluster nodes:**

1. For each node in the cluster, except the first one that is already configured, perform the steps in [Configure Quali Server on the First Cluster Node](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/HA-Install/Cnfg-Quali-srv-frst-clstr-node.htm).
2. Make sure to use the License server role IP and the AlwaysOn SQL listener IP.
