# CloudShell High Availability Installation Overview

CloudShell High Availability is available for Premium accounts only.

This guide describes the installation and configuration of the CloudShell High Availability (HA) Add-On, and should be read in conjunction with the [High Availability Deployment](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/HA-Deploy/HA-Deploy-Home.htm) guide.

The CloudShell High Availability (HA) Add-On provides you with same-site continuous operation in cases of HW/SW failure of any CloudShell component. HA typically deals with a single predictable failure, such as the failure of a processor, memory or power supply. CloudShell HA is based on a failover cluster where all nodes are in a single site.

This is achieved by configuring CloudShell in a failover cluster. A failover cluster is a group of independent servers (nodes) that work together to increase the availability and scalability of clustered nodes. The clustered nodes are connected by physical cables and by software. If a failure occurs and the active cluster node goes down, the clustering solution changes the active node automatically to the standby server and Quali server starts on the new active node.

:::info Important
An HA configuration does not substitute for a Disaster Recovery (DR) strategy, which aims at protecting your organization from the effects of significant negative incidents and allows you to quickly resume mission-critical functions following a disaster. Defining an organizationâ€™s DR strategy is based on mapping the potential disaster risks and establishing a plan that may involve manual and/or automated actions and the use of various software tools and technologies.
