# Embedding Dashboards in External Websites

Sisense dashboards can be shared with unregistered users, as follows:

- By sharing a dashboard or widget with users who do not have a Sisense user account.

- Embedding a Sisense dashboard or widget in external web sites (for example, show productivity charts in team websites).Â 

:::note
The Sisense license limits the number of user profiles. The creation process might therefore result in an error if the maximum available user profiles is reached.
