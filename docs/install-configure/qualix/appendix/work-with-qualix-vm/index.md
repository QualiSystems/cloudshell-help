# Working with QualiX VM

This section describes how to use functions to copy text to and from machines by using RDP/SSH through your browser, and how to transfer files to and from client machines. There is also an example of how to create attributes, resources, and blueprints, and then how to reserve the new blueprints.
:::note
QualiX 3.2 on Docker provides clipboard integration, allowing you to copy/paste content and files to and from docker.
