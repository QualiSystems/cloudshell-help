# Downloading the QualiX Installation Files

**To download the QualiX installation files:**

1. Download the appropriate **QualiX Server extension**.
    
    - The vCenter image is available in [QualiX Download Center](https://support.quali.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037650694).
        
        :::note
        Downloading the vCenter image requires registration to the Quali Support Portal. If you have not registered, click this link to register [New registration](https://support.quali.com/).
        :::
        
    - The script for installing the dockerized QualiX image is embedded in the installation instructions at [Deploy QualiX 4.1 using Docker](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/QualiX/Instl-Cnfg-Docker.htm) and [Deploy QualiX 5.0 and up Using Docker](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/QualiX/Instl-Cnfg-Docker-5.0.htm).
        
2. Download the files into a temporary location on your local machine.
    
    The vCenter folder contains an .md5 file with a list of files in that folder and their md5 checksum.
    
3. Next, deploy the QualiX VM or docker containers, as explained in [Installation and Configuration](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/QualiX/Instl-Cnfg.htm).
