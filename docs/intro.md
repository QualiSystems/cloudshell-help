## What is CloudShell?

CloudShell is a cloud automation platform that lets you deliver fully functional sandboxes over any combination of infrastructure, from legacy to public cloud, and eliminate resource conflicts. Creating an IT environment blueprint can be as simple as dragging the resources you need from the inventory and creating the connections between them.

Take a guided tour through CloudShell in this demo video.
