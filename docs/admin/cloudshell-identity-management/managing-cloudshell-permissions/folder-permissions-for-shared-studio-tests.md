# Folder Permissions for Shared Studio Tests

Admin users can set permissions for Shared tests.

By default:

- Folder permissions are inherited from the root Shared folder.
- The admin user can configure specific permissions per user or group for any folder or test in the Shared repository
- Any user can open tests from any Shared folder or sub-folder.
- Any user can add new folders and tests to the Shared repository.
- Only the admin owner or owner can rename, modify or delete folders or folder contents. Admin users cannot remove owner permissions on Shared tests. For additional information, see Creating folders.

**To set permissions for a shared tests folder:**

- Right-click the folder and choose **Properties** from the context menu.
