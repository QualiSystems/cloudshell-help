# SAML Authentication Configuration (SSO / SLO)

*SSO/SLO configuration is available with CloudShell Premium Tier.*

Single sign-on is an access control and authentication method that enables you to access several services through a single login page, prompting you to enter your credentials only once. You can use SSO to enable your users to access CloudShell through your homepage, and Single Logout (SLO) to log your users back out to their respective homepages. Single sign-on to CloudShell Portal is done using SAML via Kentor authentication services.
