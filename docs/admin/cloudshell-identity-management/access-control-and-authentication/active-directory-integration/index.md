# Active Directory Integration

CloudShell provides built-in integration with Microsoft Active Directory services for user authentication and authorization. To learn how to use Active Directory with CloudShell, see the following articles:

- [Configuring CloudShell to Automatically Import Active Directory Users on First Login](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/AD-Intg-Auto-Imprt.htm)

If you cannot integrate with Active Directory, we also support integration with an LDAP, SSO or JWT solution:
