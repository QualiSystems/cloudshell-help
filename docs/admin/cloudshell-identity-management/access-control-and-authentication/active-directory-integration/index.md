# Active Directory Integration

CloudShell provides built-in integration with Microsoft Active Directory services for user authentication and authorization. To learn how to use Active Directory with CloudShell, see the following articles:

- [Importing users into CloudShell from an active directory](../../../../admin/cloudshell-identity-management/access-control-and-authentication/active-directory-integration/importing-users-into-cloudshell-from-an-active-directory.md)
- [Configuring CloudShell to Automatically Import Active Directory Users on First Login](../../../../admin/cloudshell-identity-management/access-control-and-authentication/active-directory-integration/configuring-cloudshell-to-automatically-import-active-directory-users-on-first-login.md)

If you cannot integrate with Active Directory, we also support integration with an LDAP, SSO or JWT solution:

- [Configuring Single Sign-On (SSO)](../../../../admin/cloudshell-identity-management/access-control-and-authentication/saml-authentication-configuration-sso-slo/configure-sso/index.md)
