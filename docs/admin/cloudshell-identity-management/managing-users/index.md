# Managing Users

User permissions in CloudShell are based on the user's group memberships. The System Administrator grants user permissions by adding users to groups. System administrators can be defined by other system administrators when creating a user profile, as explained in [Managing CloudShell Users](../../../admin/cloudshell-identity-management/managing-users/managing-cloudshell-users.md).

Each group in the system is assigned with a group role. The group role defines the permissions for all the users added to the group.

The available group roles are:

- Domain admins
- Regular users â€“ default role for new group.
- External users

For details about each role, see [Managing CloudShell Groups](../../../admin/cloudshell-identity-management/managing-users/managing-cloudshell-groups.md).
