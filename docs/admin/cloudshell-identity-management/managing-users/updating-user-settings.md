# Updating User Settings

You can modify the user's email and change the user's status in **Resource Manager Client**, and, if enabled, from **CloudShell Portal**. This procedure explains how to do so in Resource Manager Client. For information about modifying user settings in CloudShell Portal, see [Logging into CloudShell](../../../portal/overview/logging-in.md).

**To edit an existing user:**

1. In **Resource Manager Client**, click the **Admin** tab's **Users** icon.
2. In the **Users** tab, select the user from the list and click the **Edit** button.
If this user was imported from an Active Directory of a Windows Domain, the Imported checkbox will be selected and the Email field will be disabled.  
The **Edit User** window also displays all of the user's group memberships.
3. Perform the required changes and click **OK** to apply.

**To change a user's password:**

1. Select the user in the list and click the **Change Password** button.

4. Click **OK** to confirm.
