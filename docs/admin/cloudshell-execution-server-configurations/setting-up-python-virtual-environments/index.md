# Setting Up Python Virtual Environments

You can use Python virtual environments in CloudShell in order to isolate the different Python drivers and scripts, and enable CloudShell to install their dependencies without worrying about contradicting dependencies in different driver or script versions.

The following articles describe what Python virtual environments are, how to configure virtual environments, manage the Execution Server, manage driver dependencies, implement manual processes (when required) to run Python drivers in CloudShell, and remove unneeded virtual environments to free up disk space.
