# Add OpenStack Cloud Provider Resource

The OpenStack 2<sup>nd</sup> Gen cloud provider enables the deployment of OpenStack instances from images. CloudShell supports OpenStack releases Ocata, Pike, Queens, Rocky, Stein, Train, Ussuri, Victoria and Wallaby.

:::note Notes:
- The OpenStack 2<sup>nd</sup> Gen shell is available for download from [Quali Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/QualiSystems/discussions/categories/integrations).
- OpenStack elements created by the CloudShell management network should not be altered as this may cause unexpected behavior.
:::
**To add an OpenStack cloud provider resource:**

1. Log in to CloudShell Portal as administrator.
2. Import the OpenStack 2G shell into CloudShell. For details, see [Importing Shells](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Shells.htm#Adding).

    :::note
    The resource's name has a limit of 100 characters and can only contain alpha-numeric characters, spaces, and the following characters: | . - \_ \] \[
    :::
7. Enter the **IPÂ Address** of the OpenStack server that will be used to deploy the virtual machines.
8. Click **Create**.
    
    The **Resource** dialog box is displayed.

    The physical interface can be found under the connectivity provider configuration in your OpenStack plugin's agent file. For example:

    - For Linux Bridge plugin: `/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/linuxbridge_agent.ini` file > `[linux_bridge]` configuration section > `physical_interface_mappings` attribute.
        
        For example: `physical_interface_mappings = public:em1,office:p1p2,quali:em2`.
        
    - For Open vSwitch plugin: `/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/openvswitch_agent.ini` file > `[ovs]` configuration section > `bridge_mappings` attribute.
        
        For example: `bridge_mappings = public:br-vlan`.

    - **Remain Powered On**: The VM will remain powered on during the saving state.
    - **Power Off**: If the VM was powered on before the sandbox entered the saving state, the VM will shut down (power off) for the duration of the save.
    :::note    
    After save has ended, the VM returns to its state prior to saving, regardless of the behavior during the save.

    This attribute is typically used for different sites or domains. For additional information on managing App deployments per domains, see [Managing Private Cloud Apps in Domains](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Mng-Prvt-Cld-Apps-in-Dmns.htm).

10.  Click **Start Discovery** to validate the OpenStack settings.
    
        When the discovery process completes, a confirmation message is displayed. The resource is displayed in the **Inventory** dashboard in CloudShell Portal and in Resource Manager.
        
        Apps can now be added using the OpenStack resource. For additional information, see [Adding App templates](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Apps.htm#Adding).
