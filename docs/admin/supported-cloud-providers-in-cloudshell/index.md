# Supported Cloud Providers in CloudShell

Note that we're adding cloud provider shells to [Quali Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/QualiSystems/discussions/categories/integrations) all the time. For additional information, see [Cloud Provider Shells - Features and Capabilities Per Release](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Clp-capabilities.htm).

In addition, the **Custom Cloud Provider** Shell is provided to enable you to develop support for cloud providers that are not supported out of the box. For details, see [Developing Custom Cloud Provider Shells](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/DevGuide/Cld-Prvdrs/Developing-Cloud-Shells.htm).
