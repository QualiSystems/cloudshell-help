# AWS Integration and Configuration

To enable CloudShell Apps to deploy virtual machines in AWS, the system administrator needs to integrate AWS with CloudShell, and associate each App template with the domain of the CloudShell cloud provider resource the admin created during the integration process. To manage AWS costs, the system administrator can set up budgeting limits for CloudShell-created AWS resources such as instances.

:::note Important
AWS elements created by CloudShell should not be altered as this may cause unexpected behavior.
