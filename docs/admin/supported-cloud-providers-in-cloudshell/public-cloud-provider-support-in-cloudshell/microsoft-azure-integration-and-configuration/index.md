# Microsoft Azure Integration and Configuration

To enable CloudShell Apps to deploy virtual machines in Microsoft Azure, the system administrator needs to integrate Azure with CloudShell, associate each App template with the domain of the CloudShell cloud provider resource the admin created during the integration process. You can also track the cost of your CloudShell activity on Azure using CloudShell tags that are attached to all Azure resources created by CloudShell, such as virtual machines and VNets.

:::note Important
Azure elements created by CloudShell should not be altered as this may cause unexpected behavior.
