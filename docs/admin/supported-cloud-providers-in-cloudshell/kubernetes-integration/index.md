# Kubernetes Integration

The Kubernetes deployment type integrates CloudShell with Kubernetes. This integration enables the deployment of CloudShell Apps in self-hosted and cloud-managed Kubernetes containers. CloudShell supports deploying Kubernetes pods from images residing in the cluster's image registry.

The following diagram illustrates an Kubernetes integration (with a local CloudShell installation) hosting two live sandboxes:

CloudShell communicates with the Kubernetes cluster over the Kubernetes API to deploy and manage container instances as part of CloudShell sandboxes.

When deploying a sandbox, CloudShell creates a Kubernetes deployment in a dedicated namespace for the sandbox. The deployment spins up 1 or more pods for each Kubernetes App (number of pods are defined in the Appâ€™s settings) as well as services for exposing the internal and external ports defined in the App. A dedicated service is created for each port. For each internal port, a ClusterIP service is created, and for each external port, a LoadBalancer or NodePort service is created.

:::note Notes
- CloudShell does not manage Kubernetes App connectivity at this time. This can be done using the external and internal ports defined in the App.
- When the sandbox ends, the sandbox's namespace along with all its components are automatically deleted from the cluster.
- The App's external IP is displayed in the VM Details pane. For details, see [View an App's VM Details](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/App-Actns/Sndbx-Apps-VM-Details.htm).

## Kubernetes installation workflow

To integrate Kubernetes with CloudShell, perform the following steps:
