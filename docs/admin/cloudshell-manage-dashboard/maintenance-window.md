# Maintenance Window

## About the maintenance window

**Maintenance Window** allows system admins to schedule and notify users of an immediate or upcoming system-wide maintenance. For example, to perform an upgrade or any other preventive maintenance that could cause disruption of service. During the maintenance window, only system administrators and domain administrators can log in to CloudShell, schedule and work in sandboxes, and launch jobs.

The maintenance window is system-wide and applies to all domains.

If a non-admin user attempts to log in during this period, they will get a canned message. If they are logged in when the maintenance window starts, they will be logged-out and redirected to the login page and presented with the **Message on Login** message.

Additional points to consider when a maintenance window is defined:

- Sandboxes scheduled before the maintenance window will run as usual even if they overlap with the maintenance window. Admin users can view all sandboxes scheduled for the maintenance window duration, by clicking the **Go to Sandboxes** button. See the [Navigating the maintenance window](../../admin/cloudshell-manage-dashboard/maintenance-window.md#navigating-the-maintenance-window) section.
- If a regular user reserves or restores a sandbox that starts or ends outside the maintenance window, the sandbox will be reserved or restored as usual. Users are warned that they will not have access to the sandbox during the maintenance period.
- Admins can run automation suites during the maintenance window.
- Reserving a recurring sandbox is blocked if all the occurrences start or end during the maintenance window. Otherwise, the sandbox will start as usual.
- You cannot change the timeslot of a reservation that falls within the maintenance window.
- Automation suite jobs moved to the scheduled queue after the maintenance window was created will run as usual unless they overlap the maintenance window. If this occurs, they will run after the maintenance window.
- Automation suite jobs that were set to run automatically before the maintenance window was created or during the period in which the maintenance window was extended will fail if they overlap with the maintenance window.
- API: non-admin users cannot create a new session during a maintenance window. If they are in the middle of a session, the session will not be terminated, but they will be logged out on the session timeout.
