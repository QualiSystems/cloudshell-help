# Required Actions for Incomplete Work Order Resources

Each work order resource that is not yet complete and has an issue blocking completion will have Required Actions. In the Work Order UI, by clicking on the warning or error indicator, users can see what is blocking completion and, in some cases, remediate the issue automatically.

For example:

If the sub-resource is not part of its parent, you can indicate that you have moved it in the real world and update Cloudshell to reflect that it has been moved.

Since an Assembly Lab involves moving devices in the lab, tracking the "real world" resource structure and cabling is critical. The purpose of the work order is not only to help reserve the right resources but also to indicate changes to the data that reflect what is happening in the lab.
