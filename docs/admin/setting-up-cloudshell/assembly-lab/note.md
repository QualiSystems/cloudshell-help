# Limitations


:::warning
Recurring sandboxes are not currently supported in assembly lab
:::

:::note
Once a domain has been configured as an assembly lab domain, do not try to change it back to a non-assembly lab domain. Assembly Lab domains have a different set of rules for resource management and blueprint resolution which are not compatible with standard domain operation.
