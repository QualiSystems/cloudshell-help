# Viewing Resource Live Status

In the **Inventory** dashboard, you can see the live status of resources that are in active sandboxes. The sandbox live status icon displays additional information about the current sandbox. The live status indication is activated via API. The ![](/Images/CloudShell-Portal/Lab-Management/Reservations/In_a_ReservationIcon.png) icon indicates that the resource is part of an active sandbox.
