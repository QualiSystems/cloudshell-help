:::info
Some of the articles in this chapter apply to 1st Gen shells only. Even though CloudShell still supports 1st Gen shells, we recommend using 2nd Gen shells, which offer enhanced shell management capabilities. For details, see [Shells Overview](https://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/0.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Features/Shells.htm).

This chapter explains how to configure your resources and services in CloudShell. This includes setting up the families and models, associating attributes and drivers, and associating the resources and services to domains in order to enable the domain users to access and use them.
