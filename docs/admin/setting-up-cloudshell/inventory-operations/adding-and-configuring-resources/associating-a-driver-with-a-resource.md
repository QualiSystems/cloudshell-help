# Associating a Driver with a Resource

:::note
This article only applies to resources based on 1st Gen shells. While CloudShell supports 1st Gen shells, we recommend using 2nd Gen shells, which offer enhanced shell management capabilities. For details, see [Shells Overview](../../../../intro/features/shells.md).
:::

A driver provides commands that can be run on the resources to which it is associated.

:::note
Resource drivers are supported for backwards compatibility only.

**To associate a driver with a resource:**

1. Make sure the driver is associated to the resource model. For additional information, see [Associating a driver to a resource model](../resource-data-modeling-for-1st-gen-shells/defining-the-resource-data-model.md#associating-a-driver-to-a-resource-model).

1. Right-click the resource and select **Configuration** from the context menu.
