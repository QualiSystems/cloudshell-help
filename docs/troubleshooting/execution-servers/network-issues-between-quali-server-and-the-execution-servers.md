# Network Issues between Quali Server and the Execution Servers

If you are experiencing network-related issues between Quali Server and an Execution Server, such as the following, you are advised to contact Quali Support at: [support.quali.com](https://support.quali.com/).

Quali Support can assist you in testing your network and in adjusting your configuration to help solve these issues.

- The Execution Server's connection status changes frequently from online to offline.
- The Execution Server appears offline even though the `QsExecutionServer.exe` Windows process is running as seen in the [Execution Servers - Servers Page](../../admin/cloudshell-manage-dashboard/managing-execution-servers/execution-servers-servers-page.md).
- Commands seem to take longer than usual on the Execution Server as seen in the [Execution Servers - Commands Queue Page](../../admin/cloudshell-manage-dashboard/managing-execution-servers/execution-servers-commands-queue-page.md).
- Errors occur when attempting to stop a command or a test from the [Execution Servers - Executions Page](../../admin/cloudshell-manage-dashboard/managing-execution-servers/execution-servers-executions-page.md) or during execution, see [Run Commands](../../portal/sandboxes/sandbox-workspace/run-commands.md).
