# What is My QualiX Version?

It is important to know which version of QualiX you are using, as different QualiX versions may include different features and use different configurations. Finding your QualiX version is easy:

- From a machine with access to your QualiX machine, type the IP address of the QualiX on a browser URL (the IP address is specified in the Quali Server's `ServerUniversalSettings.xml`).
    
    The QualiX version is displayed in the bottom right of the screen.
